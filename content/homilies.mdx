# Proverbs

## Proverbs 16:18
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on pride
</div>
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Pride goes before disaster, and a haughty spirit before a fall"* (Proverbs 16:18)
</div>
Of all that exists at the four corners of the earth, what, O mortal man, can make us proud except stupidities and demonic illusions? Did we not enter into the world naked and wretched, and are we not going to depart this world in the same manner? Everything that we have, did we not borrow it; and at our death, are we not going to return everything? Oh, how many times has this been said and ignored? The wise apostle says: *For we have brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out* (I Timothy 6:7). And when we offer the sacrifice to God of ordinary bread and wine, we say: "Thine own of Thine own, we offer unto Thee" (Divine Liturgy of St. [John Chrysostom](/november/13th)). For nothing that we have in this world is ours, not even a crumb of bread or a drop of wine—there is nothing that is not of God. In truth, pride is the daughter of stupidity, the daughter of a darkened mind, born of evil ties with the demons.

Pride is a broad window through which all of our merits and good works evaporate. Nothing makes us so empty before men and so unworthy before God as does pride. If the Lord is not proud, why should we be proud? Who has more reason to be proud than the Lord, Who created the world and Who sustains it by His power? And behold, He humbles himself as a servant, a servant to the whole world—a servant even to death, to death on the Cross!

O humble Lord, burn up within our hearts the devil's sowing of pride with the fire of Thy Holy Spirit, and plant within it the noble sowing of humility and meekness.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Psalms


## Psalm 16:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the fulfillment of the prophecy
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Because Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether world, nor wilt Thou suffer Thy faithful one to undergo corruption"* (Psalm 16:10).
</div>
These are the words of the inspired seer of mysteries—glowing, prophetic words. David speaks these words about Christ the Lord, about His soul and about His body, i.e., about that which is human in Him. That these words of David pertain to the resurrected Christ was witnessed by the Apostle Peter in his first sermon immediately after the descent of the Holy Spirit: *Because you will not abandon my soul to the nether world nor will you suffer your holy one to see corruption* (Acts 2:27). For, the apostle says, *the patriarch David ...  is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day* (Acts 2:29). It is not possible that those words refer to David, although David speaks as though they are from him and refer to him; but rather those words refer to a descendant of David according to the flesh. The body of David is decomposed, as are the bodies of his other descendants. Christ, therefore, is David's descendant in the flesh Who did not remain in hades and Whose body did not see corruption. *He* [David] *seeing this before spake of the Resurrection of Christ* (Acts 2:31). Truly, a glowing prophecy! Truly, a wondrous foresight! Before the Resurrection of the Lord, these words must have sounded unintelligible and irrational for all the Jewish interpreters of the Psalms! When the seal on the tomb is removed, then the seal of the many totally obscure and unclear prophecies is also removed. Christ resurrects and the mysteries become known. The seal of the tomb is removed not only from His body but also from the countless words and visions of the prophets. Christ resurrects and the prophetic words are also resurrected. Descending into hades, the Lord brought the heavenly light to the souls of the righteous fathers and prophets. By His Resurrection, He brought their words and visions to the light of understanding and truth. Christ resurrects and all that is good, righteous and truthful, before and after the Resurrection morning, is also resurrected.

O resurrected Lord, place us among the resurrected citizens of Thine Eternal Kingdom.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Psalm 34:15
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
**On how we should depart from evil and do good**
</div>
<br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Turn from evil, and do good"* (Psalm 34:15)
</div>
With these words are expressed all the efforts by which we should labor here on earth and in the earth, i.e., on this material earth and in this physical body. In what, then, should our labor consist? To achieve two habits: first, to avoid evil and second, to do good. Concerning that which is good and that which is evil, our conscience tells us incompletely and unclearly, because our conscience is darkened by sin; but the teaching of Christ tells us completely and clearly that which is good and that which is evil.

Brethren, what does our Lord ask of us? He asks that, as our altars are always facing the east, so should our souls be turned toward good. To leave evil behind us; leave evil in the shadows; leave evil in the abyss of oblivion; leave evil in the darkness of the past; that we, from year to year, from day to day, extend ourselves toward good—think about good, yearn for good, speak about good, do good. The Lord is seeking builders and not destroyers. He who builds good, by the same act destroys evil. However, he who turns away from destroying evil, quickly forgets how to build good and is transformed into an evildoer.

The Apostle of Christ teaches us, *Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good* (Romans 12:9). Hate evil but do not hate the man who commits evil for he is sick. If you can, heal the sick person but do not kill him with your hatred. Adhere to good and only good, for good is from God, for God is the treasury of all good.

O Good and All-gracious Lord, teach us to avoid evil and to do good for the sake of Thy glory and for the sake of our salvation.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Isaiah

## Isaiah 53:7
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the fulfillment of the great prophecy
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Like a lamb led to the slaughter"* (Isaiah 53:7).
</div>
Through many centuries of time, the discerning Prophet Isaiah foresaw the awesome sacrifice on Golgotha. From afar he saw the Lord Jesus Christ led to the slaughter as a lamb is led. A lamb permits itself to be led to the laughter as it is led to the pasture: defenseless, without fear, and without malice. Thus, our Lord Christ was led to the slaughter without defense, without fear, and without malice. He does not say, "Men, do not do this!" nor does He ask, "Why are you doing this to Me?" nor does He condemn anyone. Nor does He protest. Nor does He become angry. Nor does He think evilly of His judges. When, from the crown of thorns, His blood flowed, He was silent. When His face was soiled from being spat upon, He was silent. When His Cross became heavy along the way, He endured. When His pain became unbearable on the Cross, He complained not to men but to the Father. When He breathed His last, He directed His gaze and sighs toward heaven and not toward earth. For the source of His strength is heaven and not earth. The source of His consolation is in God and not in men. His true homeland is the Heavenly Kingdom and not the earthly kingdom.

Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world (John 1:29). This was the first exclamation of St. John the Baptist when he saw the Lord. And, behold, now on Golgotha that prophecy was fulfilled. Behold, under the weight of the sins of the entire world, the Lamb of God lay slaughtered and lifeless.

O brethren, this costly sacrifice was made for our sins as well. The blood of this sinless and meek Lamb was destined for all times and all generations, from the first to the last person on earth. Christ also felt the pains on the Cross for our sins, even those of the present day. He also wept in the Garden of Gethsemane for our wickedness, our weakness and our sinfulness. He also destined His blood for us. Brethren, let us not then despise the indescribable costly price by which we have been redeemed. Because of this sacrifice of Christ we, indeed, have some worth as people. Without this sacrifice, or if we disavow this sacrifice, our worth, by itself alone, is equal to nothing. It is equal to smoke without a flame or a cloud without light.

O Lord, unequaled in mercy, have mercy on us also!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Matthew

## Matthew 6:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on submission to the will of God
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Thy will be done, in earth as in heaven"* (Matthew 6:10).
</div>

Blessed be John the Baptist, for he fulfilled the Gospel before the arrival of the Gospel! Going into the wilderness, he gave himself up completely to the will of God, both body and soul. The will of God was carried out in his body on earth as well as in the heaven of his soul. Neither hunger nor wild beasts did harm to his body throughout the many years that he spent in the wilderness. His soul was harmed neither by despair in loneliness nor by pride in heavenly visions. He sought neither bread nor knowledge from man. God granted him everything that was necessary for him, because he gave himself up completely to the will of God.

He directed his footsteps neither into the wilderness nor away from the wilderness. An invisible rudder from on high steered his life. For when it was necessary for him to depart from the wilderness and go out to meet the Lord, it is said: *The word of God came unto John* (Luke 3:2). Like an innocent youth, John spoke simply about his communication with the powers of heaven: *And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God* (John 1:33-34). How tenderly and simply he speaks about heavenly things! How terrifying like a lion he is when he speaks out against the injustice of men, against Herod and Herodias! The lamb and the lion dwell in him together. Heaven is as close to him as a mother is to her child. The will of God is as accessible and clear to him as it is to the angels in heaven.

O Lord, most wise, direct the lives of us sinners in the wilderness of this life according to Thy will, as Thou didst direct the life of St. John the Baptist.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 7:21
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on how the Kingdom of God is gained with the heart and not with the tongue
</div>
<br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven"* (Matthew 7:21).
</div>

Brethren, one does not gain the Kingdom of God with the tongue, but with the heart. The heart is the treasury of those riches by which the kingdom is purchased—the heart, and not the tongue! If the treasury is filled with the riches of God (i.e., strong faith, good hope, ardent love and good deeds), then the herald of those riches—the tongue—is faithful and pleasant. If the treasury is devoid of all those riches, then its herald is false and impudent. As the heart is, so are the words. As the heart is, so are the deeds. All, all depends on the heart.

Hypocrisy is helpless before men and is even more helpless before God. If then, I am a father, says the Lord through the Prophet Malachi, *If then I am a father, where is the honor due to Me? And If I am a master, where is the reverence due to Me?* (Malachi 1:6). That is: "I hear you call Me 'Father,' but I do not see you honoring Me with your heart. I hear you call Me 'Master,' but I do not see fear of Me in your hearts."

Our prayer, "Lord! Lord!" is beautiful and beneficial only when it emerges from a prayerful heart. The Lord Himself commanded that we pray unceasingly, not only with the tongue to be heard by men, but rather enclosed in the cell of the heart, so that the Lord can hear and see us.

O Lord, majestic and wonderful, deliver us from hypocrisy and pour Thy fear into our hearts, so that our hearts may stand continually upright in prayer before Thee.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 8:27
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the confusion of those of little faith
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"* (Matthew 8:27).
</div>
The apostles questioned thus among themselves, not yet knowing the Lord Jesus, yet seeing how He calmed the turbulent sea and winds: What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? This is He Who created the winds and the sea. Therefore, what kind of miracle is it that His own created things obey Him? Is not the axe an obedient tool in the hands of him who made it? The Lord created everything by His word; that is why all things submit to His word.

Brethren, what sort of man is this? Who is He? This is the same One Who aforetime raised the winds and quieted them, and Who agitated the sea and subdued it. This is the same One Who also does this today. As a man, He stood before men and rebuked the animated wind and unbridled sea, in order to dispel the superstitions of men—that the winds and the sea are moved and calmed either by blind chance or by some evil power—and to reveal the truth forever, that the wise and beneficial power of the Creator directs and commands all the elements, according to His providence.

The apostles asked: "Who is He?" O Holy Apostles, He is the sinless Son of God, Whose name you will spread throughout the whole world, and for Whose name you will be tortured and slain as lambs by wolves. Who are the wolves? The wolves are those who think that the wind moves and the sea agitates and calms either of themselves only or of the devil. O Holy Apostles, you who asked and who received a true reply and proclaimed the whole truth to the whole world, pray for us so that we too may be enlightened by that truth.

O Lord, all-wise and all-powerful, calm the winds of sin and subdue the storm of our filthy and unworthy passions.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 9:4
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the most-discerning Prophet
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"* (Matthew 9:4).
</div>
When our Lord deigned to direct a rebuke to the Pharisees and scribes, they had, as yet, neither killed anyone, nor deceived anyone, nor robbed anyone. Not only that: they had not yet even offended anyone by their words. Why then did our Lord admonish them when they had not committed any sin either in works or in words? Why? Because their thoughts were evil.

An evil thought is sin! This is the great new understanding, which Christ brought into the world. In truth, an evil thought is the sinful source of all sin because, before a man says something or does something sinful, he thinks sinfully. Thought is the causative sin. All other sins are only subsequent sins. Whoever wishes to annihilate evil actions, must first uproot evil thoughts. Whoever desires to stem the flow of water, must first dry up the source. Therefore, let no one justify himself by saying: "I am not a sinner, for I have not killed anyone, robbed anyone, profaned anyone, or lied to anyone!" Behold, we are full of deadly robbing, profaning and deceiving thoughts! If we have not committed sin by our deeds, this is simply a matter of the mercy of God and external circumstances. But, if God had allowed it, and if the circumstances had been favorable, we would have committed all those sins that we thought of. The serpent is venomous not only when it bites but also when it does not bite—because it carries the venom in itself.

Therefore, not only is thought a sin, but it is also the source of sin, the beginning of sin, the seed and the root of sin. That is why the All-seeing and All-knowing Lord rebuked those who had evil thoughts. Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?

O Lord, all-seeing and all-knowing, help us to cleanse our hearts and minds from evil thoughts, so that our words and deeds may be pure.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## Matthew 10:19-20
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Spirit of God, Who speaks through the Spirit-bearers
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Take no thought how or what ye shall speak ... For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you"* (Matthew 10:19-20).
</div>
These are the words of Him Who knows all and Who declared to the world knowledge which was unknown before He visited mankind. If someone is filled with the Spirit of God, he does not speak from the spirit of man. Instead, the Spirit of God speaks from him and through him. He is only an instrument or a lyre of God's Spirit, through which God the Spirit speaks. When that kind of man speaks, he speaks infallibly and no one can find falsehood in his speech except those who, because of the perversion of their minds, consider truth as falsehood. How men speak when filled with the Spirit of God was clearly shown by the example of the prophets, and more clearly by the example of the apostles. So miraculous and unbelievable did the words of the apostles seem to strangers—that is, to those who bereft of the Spirit of God in themselves and who were only able to speak of the earth—that they considered the apostles to be intoxicated. In reality, all those people who were the first to speak about the hidden miracles of this physical world—the power of steam, magnetism, electricity, wireless telegraphy, and conversation at a distance—appeared intoxicated and foolish to the ignorant. How can spiritual men, when led by the Spirit of God and speaking about countless hidden mysteries of the spiritual kingdom, not seem intoxicated and foolish? Whoever humbles himself before God, him God makes powerful. The Spirit of God settles in a contrite heart and from there speaks through the mouth of man. This is confirmed not only by the prophets and apostles, but also by God's innumerable sons and daughters.

O Good Lord, do not refuse us Thy Holy Spirit.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 10:26
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on revealed secrets
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known"* (Matthew 10:26).
</div>
Brethren, there is one eye that never sleeps. This is the eye of God. There are more eyes in heaven, brethren, than there are stars in the firmament of the heavens. They are the eyes of the angels. No veil or wall or darkness can conceal any secret on earth from these eyes. Everything is revealed and open before the All-seeing God and His holy angels. The man who believes that all the works of man can be hidden becomes a criminal. Thus thought the Jewish elders, who arranged and planned in secrecy their evil plot against Christ the Lord. Secretly they persecuted Him, secretly they judged Him in the darkness of night, and secretly they bribed and paid false witnesses. And, like Judas, they secretly condemned Him. Where are their secrets today? All have been revealed and opened before the entire world. It is easier for man to hide from the air than from the sight of God. All the secrets of mankind, the good and the evil, are revealed before God. A countless number of those secrets God reveals to the entire world according to His providence. Those who can understand this truth, that God sees all and knows all, carefully guard themselves in the depth of their hearts from evil thoughts and especially from evil deeds. Whenever your heart entices you to do evil, O man, call to mind these words which are not of man but of God: There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. And you, whatever good you do in secret, do not become faint-hearted. All of your good is written in heaven and will be revealed in its time.

O All-seeing Lord, help us and save us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## Matthew 10:30
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on God's omniscience and providence
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered"* (Matthew 10:30).
</div>
Brethren, the very hairs of your head are all numbered—even more so are the days of your life! Do not be afraid, therefore, that you will die before your appointed time, or yet hope that you will somehow be able to extend your life for one day beyond the will of Him Who counts and measures. Let this knowledge teach you meekness and fear of God.

The very hairs of your head are all numbered—even more so are your sufferings on earth! Do not be afraid, therefore, that you will suffer beyond measure. Fear even less that your sufferings will remain forgotten and unaccounted for by Him Who sees all. This knowledge will teach you patience and confidence toward your Creator and Provider. The very hairs of your head are all numbered—even more so are your friends and enemies on earth! Do not be afraid, therefore, that you will have either too many friends or too many enemies. Neither be afraid that your enemies will overcome you, nor be assured that your friends will defend you. Concern yourself only that you have God for a friend, and do not be afraid of anything. Behold, He Who loves you unalterably is your only friend.

O Good Lord, Wise Provider, Who knows the number, measure and time of all, banish from us every fear—except the fear of Thee—that through fear of Thee, we may arrive at the pure and holy love for Thee, our Creator and Benefactor.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 10:37
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on love above every other love
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me"* (Matthew 10:37).
</div>
The entire Gospel teaches that we should leave the lesser for the sake of the greater, the transient for the enduring, the worst for the best, the less valuable for the more valuable. If the Good News did not promise greater worth, who would leave the lesser? If the Gospel did not reveal the splendor of the precious goods, who would leave the cheaper goods? Who would leave milk and honey if he did not find something sweeter? Who would leave father and mother if he did not find someone closer in kinship? Who would leave children and friends if he did not recognize someone more dear? Who would willingly give his life over to suffering and death if he did not perceive immortal life? The Lord Christ is sweeter than milk and honey; He is a closer kinsman to us than our father and mother; more dear to us than our own children and friends; more precious than all visible treasures; more costly than this life, for He gives life eternal. Compared to Him, everything in the world is inferior, trivial, bitter, weak, cheap and transitory. To whoever receives Him, it is easier to leave everything, because he has received the best and Him Who is the very best.

O Lord Jesus, Treasury of all eternal riches, help us to unbind ourselves from everything and to cling to Thee, our Good and our Life.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 18:3
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on how men must become like children in order to be sons of God
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven"* (Matthew 18:3).
</div>
Thus speaks the Lord, and His word is holy and true. What advantage do children have over adults? They have three advantages: in faith, in obedience, and in forgiveness. The child asks his parent about everything, and no matter what his parent replies, the child believes his parent. The child is obedient to his parent and easily subordinates his will to the will of his parent. The child is forgiving, and even though he provokes easily, he forgives quickly. Our Lord requires these three from all men, that is, faith, obedience and forgiveness. He desires that men believe in Him unconditionally, as a child believes in his parent; that they be unconditionally obedient to Him, as a child is to his parent, and that they be forgiving in relation to one anther, not remembering evil and not rendering evil for evil.

Faith, obedience and forgiveness are the three main characteristics of a child's soul. Purity and joy are in addition to these. A child is not greedy, a child is not lustful, and a child is not vainglorious. The child's eye  is unspoiled by vices, and his joy is unspoiled by worries.

O brethren, who can make us over again into children? No one, except the one Christ. He can make us over into children and help us to be born again by His example, by His teaching and by the power of His Holy Spirit.

O Lord Jesus, perfect in obedience and meekness, Eternal Child of the Heavenly Father, help us to become as infants by faith in Thee, by obedience toward Thee, and by forgiveness toward one another.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 19:30
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the reversed values in the Kingdom of God
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first"* (Matthew 19:30; Luke 13:30).
</div>
How all-wise is He Who spoke these words! He did not say that all the first will be last and all the last will be first, but many. There is not one error in the Gospel, and nowhere in the Gospel is there any exaggeration.

Why did the Lord put a limit and not say "all" but rather "many?" Experience teaches us that some of those who were first in honor on earth remained first in honor with God. There have been emperors who pleased God on their thrones, and there have been men without authority who angered God throughout their life.  There have been wealthy men who were saved by their charity and faith, and there have been indigent ones who received condemnation because of their evil and unbelief. There have been learned men who kept the faith and did good deeds, and there have been unlearned men who rejected both faith and good deeds. So there were some who were first here on earth and remained first in heaven, and also there were some who were last here and remained last after death also.

But alas, many who were first here became last there. And oh, the joy, oh, the justice of God—how many who were last here have become first there!

The Lord neither emphasized nor praised one class or one occupation over all others, but He recruited and even today He recruits an army of light from all classes, occupations and professions. For Him the criteria for man is neither a crown nor a beggar's pouch, but rather faith—faith and good deeds.

O All-wise Lord, remember us also in Thy Kingdom.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 23:38
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the prophecy concerning the desolate house
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate"* (Matthew 23:38).
</div>
Why did our Lord remain silent at the judgment before the Jews and before Pilate? Because, prior to that, He had said everything that needed to be said. He foretold how the Jewish elders would give him over to the unbelievers, and how they would kill Him. Many times He had foretold what would personally befall Him. His apostles heard and carefully remembered this. He also foretold the terrible punishment that the Jews would assume upon themselves for their evil acts against the Son of God. And the Jews heard this—and forgot.

Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. The Lord foretold this about the Jews. And the Jews heard this and forgot it. But much later, many remembered these prophetic words, many of whom lived through the Great Evil, when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, plundering it, burning it, dispersing its inhabitants and scattering them throughout the world. Many were beheaded or strangled, starved or crucified. The Jews, out of fear and vexation, forced Pilate to raise his hand against the Lord Jesus. Afterward the Roman Empire raised its hand against the Jews. On that day when the prophecy of the Lord was fulfilled, the Roman Empire, once represented in Jerusalem by Pilate, raised its hand against Jerusalem and her children with a very sharp sword. When Emperor Hadrian restored Jerusalem, he renamed it[^1] and forbade the Jews from settling in Jerusalem under penalty of death. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. From that time until today, Jerusalem was left deserted by the Jews as a nation. The children of these wicked ancestors who killed Christ were dispersed everywhere, except to their own home—even to this day.[^2] Lord, Almighty and All-seeing, forgive us our sins.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 24:13
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on enduring to the end
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved"* (Matthew 24:13).
</div>
O Lord most wonderful, Thou hast endured all—everything to the end. That is why Thou becamest not only blessed but also the source of blessings for all men who desire good for themselves throughout the ages.

The apostles endured all to the end and entered into blessed eternity. The saints willingly endured difficulties and sufferings to the end and were glorified in heaven and on earth. The martyrs willingly endured all pains to the end and became the adopted fellow heirs of the Kingdom of Christ.

Every founder of a new organization recruits followers for himself with the promise of good fruits and many pleasures, but deliberately remains silent about the hardships and labors that lead to those fruits and pleasures. Our Lord Jesus is the only one Who spoke the whole truth to His followers—both the bitter and the sweet side of the truth. He did not promise fruits without service, glory without suffering, ultimate rest without the thorny path, victory without struggle, pleasure without bitterness, or the Kingdom without tears and self-denial.

Although our Lord enumerated the many difficulties that would befall His followers, in the end He does not abandon them without consolation. He gives meaning to their sufferings and does not leave them in darkness. He says: He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And what that blessing is which awaits those who endure to the end, He Himself has sufficiently revealed. This blessing has been witnessed to even until today and continues to be witnessed to by many saints, who have either appeared in glory to the faithful from the other world or who, while yet in the flesh, were raised in the spirit to a vision of that glory and blessedness which await those who are faithful, elect and persevering.

O Lord, Thou art our strength. Help us to endure to the end in the faith that Thou art beside us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 24:27
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Second Coming of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be"* (Matthew 24:27).
</div>
The Second Coming of our Lord Jesus will be an appearance in glory. Our Lord repeated this many times. Here He tells us in more detail as to what His appearance will resemble. He says it will be like lightning. Through this He reveals the five characteristics of His glorious advent.

First: His Second Coming will be unexpected, like lightning. That is why He reminded us: *Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour* (Matthew 25:13).

Second: His Second Coming will be as bright as lightning. The sun and the stars will be darkened. The entire universe will lose its radiance when He shines forth. The sinner's light and brightness are darkened; how much darker will the sinner be under this heavenly flame! That is why He reminded us to keep the lamps of our souls filled with oil and trimmed. O my brethren, let us not find ourselves in darkness in that terrible hour!

Third: His coming will be as powerful as lightning. For He Himself says elsewhere that He will come *with great power and glory* (Mark 13:26).

Fourth: His coming will be all-encompassing and known to everyone from east to west. That is, He will not appear as He did the first time—to be seen only by His disciples, or one people, or one nation, or one country, or one state—but He will appear like lightning, which all the nations and all the peoples on earth will see at once.

Fifth: Just as lightning precedes rain and hail, so shall His Second Coming precede the Dread Judgment, which will be, for the righteous and faithful, like the desired rain—and, for the unrighteous and unfaithful, like hail.

Let us make preparation, my brethren, for the clouds are gathering and the divine lightning may descend from them at any time. O Lord, great and awesome, give oil to the lamps of our souls so that we may not find ourselves in eternal darkness when Thine eternal light appears.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 24:30
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the sign of the Son of Man
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven"* (Matthew 24:30).
</div>
What kind of sign will the sign of the Son of Man be, which had once been revealed briefly? It is the Cross, brighter than the sun, which manifested itself over Jerusalem before the coming of an early personification of the Antichrist, Julian the Apostate. And, in lieu of any homily concerning this miraculous sign, it is worthwhile to quote here the letter of St. Cyril of Jerusalem written to Emperor Constantius, the son of Constantine the Great and predecessor of Julian the Apostate. A portion of his letter reads: "For in these very days of the Holy Feast of Pentecost, on the seventh of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, a gigantic cross formed of light appeared in the sky above holy Golgotha, stretching out as far as the holy Mount of Olives. It was not seen by just one or two but was most clearly displayed before the whole population of the city. Nor did it, as one might have supposed, pass away quickly like a mirage, but it was visible above the earth for some hours, while it shone with a light greater than the sun's rays. Surely, it would have been eclipsed by them, had it not exhibited to those who saw it a brilliance more powerful than the sun, so that the whole population of the city made a sudden concerted rush into the the church, being seized by fear mingled with joy at the heavenly vision. They poured in, young and old, men and women of every age, even the most secluded virgins, local inhabitants and strangers, Christians and pagans from other lands.  All of them with one soul, as if with one mouth, raised a hymn of praise to the Wonderworker, Christ Jesus our Lord, the Only-begotten Son of God, and indeed learned by experience that pious Christian teaching is to be found *not in enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power* (1 Corinthians 2:4), and not only preached by man but also attested to from the heavens by God (Hebrews 2:3-4)... We consider it our obligation not to remain silent about this heavenly vision, but to inform Your God-glorified Reverence. Therefore I have hastened to fulfill this intention through this letter."

O my brethren, everything is possible with God: both to reveal the created to man and to create the uncreated. But most importantly for us is that He wants to redeem our souls from sin and death and to give us life eternal. Let us pray to Him for this, day and night.

O Lord Almighty, To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## Matthew 25:31
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Second Coming of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory"* (Matthew 25:31).
</div>
This is how our Lord spoke just before His most horrible humiliations, before being bound, before being spat upon, before being slapped, and before being ridiculed prior to His Crucifixion. In His darkest hour, He speaks about His greatest and most glorious hour. Before His most terrible and miserable departure from this world, He speaks about His Second Coming in His glory. At His first appearance, He came from the cave in Bethlehem, humble and unseen. The second time He will come on the clouds of His angels. The first time He appeared like a nobody from the earth, and the second time He will appear from the heavens. The first time He stood and knelt on the ground, and the second time He will sit on His throne of glory.

When He comes again on His throne of glory, He will not be unseen by anyone. No one will ask, as did the Magi before his first coming: *"Where is the King?"* (Matthew 2:2). Everyone will see the King and recognize Him as the King. But this vision and recognition will be unto joy for some, and unto fear and terror for others. Just think of the joy of those who have fulfilled His commandments, those who have prayed in His name, those who have performed good works and especially those who have suffered for His name! Just think of the fear and terror of all those who have spat on Him, struck Him, and crucified Him in Jerusalem.

O Merciful Lord, forgive all of us who call upon Thy name, and who, because of our weaknesses, sin against Thee; forgive us before that great and marvelous hour when Thou shalt appear in Thy glory with all Thy holy angels.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Matthew 25:32
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Second Coming of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And before Him shall be gathered all nations"* (Matthew 25:32).
</div>
All the nations will be assembled before the Lord Jesus when He appears in His glory, surrounded by the holy angels, sitting on a throne as the Judge of all the living and the dead. All the nations will be assembled—all, without exception. Not only the Jews who tormented Him, not only the Christians who glorified Him, but also the heathen who neither knew Him nor acknowledged Him. For if He were not to appear to all nations, He would have to send someone or give something to all nations for them to know God's will and receive the message of salvation. That is why all the nations must appear before Him for judgment.

Oh, what an awesome and majestic spectacle, when all the nations and all the tribes on earth are assembled before the Lord, Who is brighter than many suns. What joy for the holy martyrs and confessors when they see how, in this countless mass of nations, there is not one tongue left to deny the divinity of the Lord Jesus! But it will be of no value to anyone in that hour and place to recognize and to confess the divinity of our great Lord, if they denied Him on earth. Accounts will settled there and then, with no gain and no loss. With whatever one appears before the Lord, with that he will be either condemned or justified.

Now is the time to acknowledge the divinity of the Lord Jesus—now, when many deny Him and when His divinity is doubted by many. They who love the Lord and who trust in all of His words will easily acknowledge this. For when He says this, what do those who love Him have to worry, to doubt, or to hesitate about?

O Lord, Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Matthew 26:24
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on Christ's prophecy concerning His Glory
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven"* (Matthew 26:24).
</div>
He who does not see God as the merciful Samaritan on earth will see Him as the dreadful Judge in heaven. So blinded were the leaders of the Jews that, in the Lord Christ, they were unable to see God, or the Messiah, or a prophet, or even simply a good man. They placed Him beneath ordinary good people. Not only that, they placed Him even lower than the thieves. They released Barabbas and they condemned Christ! In general, they did not even consider Christ a man. They spit on Him; they mocked Him; they made a masquerade of Him, as of some cheap and unneeded thing. Exactly at the moment when the Jews maliciously played with Christ as some cheap and unneeded thing, the Lord suddenly opened His mouth and spoke: Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. What a distance there is between what Christ is in truth and what the Jews held Him to be!

The Son of Man, Who sits on the right hand of Power, is the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who was seen as such soon after that by the Holy Archdeacon Stephen and many, many others. The Son of Man, Who comes on the clouds with angels and countless numbers of powers and heavenly hosts, is again that same Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, as St. John the Theologian and Evangelist saw and wrote about in his Revelation.

O my brethren, do not be misled by deluding and illusionary tales of those men who say: "When we see Christ in the heavens as God, then we will believe in Him." That faith will be too late, and that vision will be in vain. With our faith we must see Christ as God in that humiliated, spat upon, beaten, bloodied and ridiculed Man in the court of Caiaphas; in that silent and condemned One Whom the Jews considered as something cheap and unneeded and Whom they turned into a masquerade. This is the Faith that is valued in heaven. This is the Faith that is rewarded by resurrection and immortality. This is the Faith that, until now, nurtured and transplanted to heaven numerous armies of the holiest souls, the strongest characters, the most forbearing heroes, and the most illustrious minds. O humiliated Lord, raise us up to this Faith.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 26:53
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the King Who does not wish to defend Himself with His army
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?"* (Matthew 26:53).
</div>
Thus spoke the Lord to the disciple who drew a sword to defend his Teacher in the Garden of Gethsemane. It is obvious from these words that the Lord could have defended Himself if He had wanted to, not only from Judas and his company of guards, but also from Pilate and the leaders of the Jews. The might of one angel is greater than the greatest army of men; how much more so is the might of twelve legions of angels!

The Lord did not want to seek this help from the Father. In His prayer in Gethsemane, He said to His Father: Thy will be done (Matthew 26:42). And He immediately knew the will of the Father: that it was necessary that He be given over to suffering. He was in agreement with the will of His Father and set out on the path of suffering. It was necessary to depict the background darkly, that the image of the Resurrection would appear clearer. It was necessary to allow evil to compete as much as it could, so that afterward it would explode and disintegrate into nothing. It was necessary to allow evil to cry aloud, so that soon afterward it would become speechless before the miraculous Resurrection. It was necessary that all the wicked deeds of men against God should be manifested, so that all would be able to see the love and mercy of God toward mankind. The angels of God were not sent to defend Christ from the Jews; rather, the angels of God were sent, after three days, to announce the Holy Resurrection of Christ.

O Lord, All-powerful and All-merciful, have mercy on us and save us!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 27:51
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the horror of nature at the death of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"The earth did quake, and the rocks rent"* (Matthew 27:51).
</div>
Oh, what a terrible reproach against mankind! Even dead nature recognized Him Whom men were unable to recognize. All mute things trembled and began to protest, each in its own way and in its own language. The mute earth quakes—that is its language. The stones are split apart—that is their language. The sun withholds its light—that is its language. All of creation protests in its own way. All of creation is submissive to Him as it was to Adam at one time in Paradise, because all of creation recognizes Him as it did Adam in Paradise. How is it that irrational creation knew Him and was obedient to Him, we do not know. It is some kind of inner instinct of irrational creation, which came to it from the Word of God, by Whom it was created. That instinct of irrational creation is more valuable than the mind of man when the latter is darkened by sin. Of all the things that are in existence, nothing is more blind than the mind of man when darkened by sin. Not only does man fail to see that which was created to be seen, but also he sees that which is contrary to being, contrary to God, and contrary to the truth. These are the degrees of blindness beyond blindness; these are numbers below zero. This is man lower than creation. For when the priests of God in Jerusalem did not recognize their God, the storms and winds recognized Him; plants and animals recognized Him; the seas, the rivers, the earth, the stones, the stars, the sun and even the demons recognized Him. Oh, what shame this is for mankind!

The earth quaked, the rocks split and the sun hid its rays, as much in anger as in sorrow. All creation grieved over the pain of the Son of God, over Whose pain the priests in Jerusalem rejoiced. Protests, sorrow—and fear! The whole of creation was frightened at the death of Him Who had cried to it:

“Arise from nothing and rejoice in your existence," as though it wanted to say: "With whom do we remain, and who will now uphold us, now that the Almighty has given up the spirit?"

O brethren, let us be ashamed of this protest, these sorrows and this fear of the mute creation! With repentance let us cry out to the Lord, the Victor: "Forgive us, O Compassionate Lord, for indeed, whenever we sin and offend Thee, we do not know what we are doing."

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 27:52
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the miraculous opening of the graves
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"The graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose"* (Matthew 27:52).
</div>
Oh, what a great sign! The dead bodies of holy men and women recognized Him, Who had died in torment on the Cross—but the dead souls of the Jewish elders did not recognize Him. The whole of creation trembled, but only the criminal souls of Ananias, Caiphas and Herod did not tremble. Dead saints showed themselves more sensitive than living sinners. How could the dead saints remain indifferent toward their Creator on the Cross when even the dead stones could not remain indifferent? How could it be that during this event, which caused the earth to quake and the sun to hide its rays, that the bodies of the righteous could sleep in the graves—they who had fulfilled His Dispensation of old, who had hoped in Him for life, who had prophesied about Him and had closed their eyes in the hope of His coming?

Oh, what a great sign! Oh, what a great comfort it is for us who hope in the Resurrection! For according to our weakness and little faith, we could say: "Truly, Christ is Risen, but will we also be resurrected? Christ resurrected by His own power, but how shall we resurrect? Who knows if God will resurrect us by His own Power?" Here is consolation, here is proof: The graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose. This means that death was unable to annihilate even ordinary man. This means that those who are much lower than Christ are not dead like stones, but are alive like angels. This means that one day even our bodies will rise from the tombs; that we will live also. All that our Lord said is confirmed by an outpouring of countless proofs. Knowing the weakness of our faith, He proved the prophecy of the resurrection not only by His particular Resurrection, but also by His raising many bodies from the tombs at the time of His own death.

O brethren, not one of us will have the least excuse for not believing in life after death. O Lord All-merciful, confirm the faithful in the Faith and convert the unbelieving to the Faith.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 27:54
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on recognizing the Son of Man amidst overwhelming darkness
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Truly this was the Son of God"* (Matthew 27:54).
</div>
These words were spoken by the centurion, who carried out his duties conscientiously as a soldier. Under orders of his superiors, he had to guard the body of Christ on Golgotha. Outwardly, he acted like a machine, but inwardly his soul was wide awake. He—a Roman soldier, a pagan and an idolater—saw all that had occurred at the time of the death of Christ the Lord, and cried out: Truly this was the Son of God. Not knowing about the One God and not knowing the Law and the Prophets, he immediately comprehended that which the priests of the One God and authorities of the Law and the Prophets were unable to comprehend! On this occasion, the word of God was realized: *For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind* (John 9:39). Truly, he who was blind in the spirit saw and those who thought they could see were completely blinded.

Was it possible that the Jewish elders neither saw the darkened sun, nor felt the earthquake, nor noticed how the rocks were split, nor saw that the veil in the Temple was rent, nor recognized many of the saints who came out of opened graves and appeared in Jerusalem? They saw all of this, and all of them accurately witnessed everything. Nevertheless, their spirits remained blind and their hearts stony. All of these manifestations, awesome and extraordinary, they probably interpreted as the unbelieving would do today—as coincidences and illusions. The pagans of all times interpret everything as coincidence or self-deception whenever the finger of God appears to reprimand men, to direct, or to inform them.

The Roman centurion Longinus, who was that soldier, saw all that occurred without prejudice, and beneath the Cross he confessed his faith in the Son of God. His exclamation was not wrested accidentally from his frightened heart; rather, it was his confession of faith, for which he later laid down his life in order to embrace a better life in the Kingdom of Christ.

O brethren, how great is this Roman centurion, who upon seeing the lifeless Lord crucified between thieves on the dunghill of Golgotha, recognized Him as God and confessed Him as God. O brethren, how petty are those Christians who recognize the Lord as resurrected, as glorified, as the Victor and the Victory-bearer through thousands of His saints, but who nevertheless retain in their hearts doubt like a poisonous serpent which poisons them every day and buries their lives in eternal darkness.

O Crucified and Resurrected Lord, have mercy on us and save us!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Matthew 28:20
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the living presence of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world"* (Matthew 28:20).
</div>
Here is consolation beyond consolations!

Here is consolation for those broken by the tempest! Let them only remember that Christ is there beside them, and let them not be afraid. He is the Helmsman.

Here is consolation for those who are sick! Let them know that Christ is there beside their bed, and let them not despair. He is the Physician.

Here is consolation for those who grow old! Let them not lose sight of the fact that Christ travels with them through time to all eternity, into eternal youth, and let them be at peace.

Here is consolation for those who are tormented by men! Let them not think that they are abandoned, for Christ is with them in all suffering, in court and in prison, and let them rejoice. He is the Judge.

Here is consolation for those who are disturbed by evil spirits! Let them remember that Christ is the Conqueror of evil spirits, that He is on their side, and let them be strengthened. He is the Victor.

Here is consolation for all who seek the light of justice and truth! Let them believe that Christ is closer to their souls than their eyes, and let them adhere to His leadership. He is Light.

O my brethren, in truth, Christ is constantly with us as light is constantly with eyes that see. But it is to our sorrow if the eyes of our souls are closed, for then in vain does the light labor to encounter the pupils of our eyes!  Oh, our sorrow and grief when we are not with Christ!

He goes out to meet us. Are we going out to meet Him? He wants to be with us. Do we want to be with Him? If we want consolation, we must be with Him every day, to the end of our lives.

O Lord, our only Consolation, do not leave us!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Mark 4:22
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the impossibility of secrets
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested"* (Mark 4:22).
</div>
All the secret works of man will be revealed one day. None of man's works can be hidden. The Jews thought that they could conceal from God the slaying of so many prophets, and that their bloody, villainous deed against Christ could be hidden from God and man. However, that which they thought to hide has become a daily and nightly tale, both in the heavens and on earth for thousands of years.

Judas thought to hide the traitorous agreement he had made against his Lord, but the Lord discerned this agreement and declared it to his face. *Jesus said to him, 'Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?'* (Luke 22:48).

The Lord also discerned the hearts of the Pharisees and read their evil thoughts. *Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?* (Matthew 9:4). What works, what things, what events in this world can be hidden from Him Who sees and reveals even the most secret thoughts in the hearts of men?

*For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested.* Because of this we need to fear, and because of this we need to rejoice. To fear—for all of our secret evil deeds, evil desires and evil thoughts will be brought out into the open. To rejoice—for all the good that we have performed, desired or thought in secret will be brought out into the open. If it is not brought out into the open before men, it will be brought out before the heavenly angels. The greater the fear for sinners, the greater the joy for the righteous.

O Lord, Lover of mankind, forgive us our sins and do not announce them for our destruction and to the sorrow of Thy holy angels.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Mark 8:27
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on Who Christ is
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Who do men say that I am?"* (Mark 8:27).
</div>
Brethren, it is almost two-thousand years from that day when our Lord Jesus posed this question to His disciples. From then until today, this question has been put to every generation of men, to every bright day and every dark night. And every generation of men—and every bright day and every dark night—has had to give an answer to this question. This question is the question of life or death, and the answer to it is life-bearing or death-bearing. Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God (Matthew 16:16), the Apostle Peter responded. And that reply was approved and praised by the Lord Jesus.

“Who is Christ?" men ask today. Some say, along with the Jews, that He is a destroyer of the Law and a self-styled Messiah. Others say, along with Pilate, that on the whole they cannot arrive at the truth about this man. The third say, along with the apostles, that He is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Savior, the Redeemer of the human race from sin and death, the Resurrected and the Resurrector, the Living One and the Giver of Life. And all of us, who are baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity, agree with the apostles and the Holy Apostolic Church, which with her universal voice thus confesses Christ the Lord.

O Lord, Only-begotten Son of God, help us, that we may all the days of our life believe in Thee in our hearts and confess Thee with our lips, as our God and our Savior, as the power of God and the wisdom of God (I Corinthians 1:24).

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Mark 9:29
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on fasting and prayer
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
“This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting" (Mark 9:29).
</div>
This is the saving prescription of the greatest Physician of human souls. This is the remedy tried and proven. There is not another remedy for madness. What kind of sickness is this? This is the presence and dominance of an evil spirit in a man, a dangerous evil spirit, who labors to eventually destroy the body and soul of man. The boy, whom our Lord freed from an evil spirit, had been hurled by it at times into the fire and at times into the water, just in order to destroy him.

As long as a man only philosophizes about God, he is weak and completely helpless against an evil spirit. The evil spirit ridicules the feeble sophistry of the world. But as soon as a man begins to fast and to pray to God, the evil spirit becomes filled with indescribable fear. In no way can the evil spirit tolerate the fragrance of prayer and fasting. The sweet-smelling fragrance chokes him and weakens him to utter exhaustion. In a man who only philosophizes about faith, there is spacious room in him for the demons. But in a man who sincerely begins to pray to God and to fast with patience and hope, it becomes narrow and constricted for the demon, so the demon must flee from such a man. Against certain bodily ills there exists only one remedy. Against the greatest illness of the soul, demonic possession, there exist two remedies, which must be utilized at one and the same time: fasting and prayer. The apostles and saints fasted and prayed to God. That is why they were so powerful against evil spirits.

O gracious Jesus, our Physician and Helper in all misfortunes, strengthen us by the power of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may be able to adhere to Thy saving precepts concerning fasting and prayer, for the sake of our salvation and the salvation of our fellow men.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Luke


## Luke 1:37
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the omnipotent Word of God
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For with God nothing will be impossible God"* (Luke 1:37).
</div>
Then God said, *Let there be light, and there was light* (Genesis 1:3). Until God spoke, there was no light. Nor was there anyone who could know what light was until God spoke and light came into being. In the same manner, when God spoke, water and the dry land, the firmament of the heavens, vegetation, animals and finally man came into existence. Until God spoke, none of this existed, and except for God no one could know that all of this could exist. By the power of His Word, God created all that is created on earth and in the heavens. Whatever God wanted to exist and called into being, that had to be and could not but have been, for the Word of God is irresistible and creative. The creation of the world is a great miracle accomplished by the Word of God. Having created all things, God again, by His Word, established the order of creation and the manner of behavior and relationship of creatures one with another. This order and manner which God established is a great miracle accomplished by God's Word.

There exists an order and manner among created things that is visible and comprehensible for us people; and there also exists an order and manner that is invisible and incomprehensible. According to that invisible and incomprehensible order and manner, which is a mystery hidden in the Holy Trinity, there have occurred and are occurring those manifestations that people call miracles. One such manifestation is the conception of the Lord Jesus Christ in the womb of the All-holy Virgin Mary, who had not known man. This appears like an interruption in the visible and comprehensible order and manner, but it is never an interruption for the invisible and incomprehensible order and manner. This birth is truly a great miracle; perhaps the greatest miracle that was ever revealed to us mortals. The entire created world is a miracle, and all the visible and comprehensible order and manner is a miracle, and altogether these miracles came about by the Word of God. Therefore, much in the same way, the Lord was conceived in the Virgin's womb. All were brought about by the power and Word of God. That is why the wonderful Gabriel replied to the question of the All-pure one (a question asked by all generations: *How shall this be?* [Luke 1:34]): *For with God nothing shall be impossible* (Luke 1:37).

O Lord God, our Creator, Immortal and Ever-existing Miracle-worker, enlighten our minds that we no longer doubt, but believe; and direct our tongues not to question Thee, but to praise Thee.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Luke 4:1
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
On the guidance of the Spirit of God
</div>
<br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness"* (Luke 4:1).
</div>
You see, brethren, what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. Without the Spirit of God, man is filled with worries: Where will he go and how will he act? But with the Spirit of God, man is without those worries, for then the Spirit instructs man where he will walk and how he will act. Then man becomes sinless in his movement and actions, because the Holy Spirit, Who leads and guides him, is sinless. Man can neither walk justly nor act righteously if the Omnipotent and Omniscient Spirit of God does not inform him. Whoever is not led by the Holy Spirit of God is led either by his own individual spirit or by the evil spirit of the demon. As a result of this he becomes helpless, bitter, remorseful, angry and despondent. We cannot endure the Spirit of God in His fullness as did Christ the Lord, but we can receive the Spirit of God sufficiently in order to know "whither, what and how." According to the purity of man's heart, the Holy Spirit settles in his heart and from the heart directs him.

That is why the Church often repeats this prayer to the Holy Spirit: "O Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth ... come and abide in us."

O God, O Holy Spirit, to Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Luke 5:4
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on traveling with Christ into the deep
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Launch out into the deep"* (Luke 5:4).
</div>
This is what our Lord commanded Peter and the rest of the apostles when He had finished speaking. This means that He first gave instructions and then, immediately after, He called them to action. This is also important for us. For as soon as we learn something from the Gospels, we immediately need to go out and implement it. The disciple's works are dear to the Lord—not just the disciple.

Launch out into the deep. From the shallow water along the shore, our Lord spoke to the people who were less enlightened in the mysteries of God's Kingdom, but He summoned the apostles out into the deep. There is less danger in the shallow waters, but the catch is also smaller. In the shallows there are snakes, frogs and other small repulsive water creatures; that is all the danger. In shallow waters there are only small fish; that is the entire catch. But in the greater depths, the danger is also greater. There you have large sea creatures and great storms; that is the danger. But there are also much larger and better fish in enormous quantity; that is the catch. O enlightened one, come therefore into the deep!

Launch out into the deep, mysterious sea of life, but do not proceed without Christ in your boat. By no means. You might spend the entire night of your life not catching anything, as Peter said: *We have toiled all the night and have taken nothing* (Luke 5:5). Not only that, but you could face far worse if Christ is not in your boat. Perhaps the winds will carry you away and cast you into an abyss. Perhaps the monstrous and enormous beasts of the sea will consume you. The winds, O enlightened one, are your own passions which accompany you unavoidably if you set out into the deep without Christ. The enormous and monstrous beasts of the sea are demons, who can destroy you in the blink of an eye as they destroyed the herd of two thousand (See Mark 5:13).

However, if you are going out with Christ into the deep, do not be afraid of anything, but go joyfully and courageously joined to Christ. You will lay hold of the best catch, and you will fill both boats with it—the physical and the spiritual. You will snare the best catch, O dedicated one, and you will arrive on shore without any dangers, on the shore of the Kingdom of Christ. Nowhere without Christ! Neither in shallow places nor in the deep. In the shallow places you will become vexed by hunger and by many minor annoyances, but in the deep a greater evil will befall you.

O my Almighty Savior, Thou art our Helmsman, our Defense, our Harbor.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Luke 7:49
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the confusion of those darkened by sin
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"* (Luke 7:49).
</div>
Thus asked the unrepentant sinners: "Who is this?" This is He Who feels most the sting of human sin, and upon Whom all the sins of mankind fall as blows. This is He Who, once in Paradise looked upon sinless man. This is He Who created man without sin, and this is He Who Himself is without sin, from all eternity and forever.

Only he can forgive who can also seek revenge. The strong man seeks revenge by reprisal. The weak man seeks revenge by hatred. If you are able to return the delivered blow and you do not do it, it still does not mean that you have forgiven, until you uproot the anger from your heart. Great is the One Lord, Who can both seek revenge and forgive. Great is He in His justice, for He will seek revenge on the unrepentant sinner. Great is He in His mercy, for He will forgive the penitent sinner.

Oh, if only men would know the power of the forgiveness of sins! Behold, when the sins of the blind man were forgiven, he saw. When the sins of the deaf man were forgiven, he heard. When the sins of the hunchbacked woman were forgiven, she stood erect. When the sins of the woman with the issue of blood were forgiven, she also was healed. When the sins of the man afflicted by insanity were forgiven, he became sane. When the sins of the man possessed with demons were forgiven, he was freed. When the sins of the harlot were forgiven, she too was cleansed. When the sins of the dead man were forgiven, he lived again!

Oh, how terrible is the chain of sins! How heavy are the chains of many sins! These chains are not loosened by sinful hands. But when the hands of the All-Pure Lord touch them, they become loosened and fall apart of their own accord. When the voice of the Pure One reaches them, they fall apart. And from the glance of the Pure One, they fall apart. Yes, even from the thoughts of the Pure One, they fall apart—these terrible chains of sins.

Who is this that forgiveth sins also? O sinners, this is the Lord, all-pure—and because of purity, almighty.

O Lord, all-pure and almighty, free us from the chains of sins.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

on death as sleeping
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And all wept, and bewailed her: but He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed Him to scorn, knowing that she was dead"* (Luke 8:52-53).
</div>
The reference here is to the dead daughter of Jarius. Jarius himself said that his daughter had died, and his servants confirmed this. But the Lord, the Giver of life, said: Weep not; she is not dead, and they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead. The ignorant pretend that they know better than the Knower. The blind pretend that they see better than the All-seeing One. But when the young girl arose and showed herself alive, the ignorant were *astonished with a great astonishment* (Mark 5:42).

Even today, the ignorant scoff when they hear the divine truth. Divine truth speaks: There is a Living God! And the ignorant ridicule this as though they know that there is no God. Divine truth speaks: There is a Heavenly Kingdom! And the ignorant ridicule even this as though they know that there is no Heavenly Kingdom. Divine truth asserts: The dead will resurrect! And the ignorant even deny this as though they know that this will not be. And when God appears and the angels of God appear, and the Kingdom of Heaven is made known, and the dead resurrect, then the ignorant ones will be astonished with a great astonishment.

Who can save the world from the ignorant? No one can save the world except Christ the Omniscient, the Omnipotent. By what can the ignorant be saved? By nothing except faith in Christ and and the Christian Faith. Who are the most ignorant ones in the world? They are those who deny whatever Christ affirmed and affirm whatever He denied. In a word: there are those who think that they know something contrary to the knowledge of Christ. They are the worst and the most dangerous ignoramuses, both to themselves and to others.

My brethren, know that everything and everyone can deceive us except Christ, our Lord and Friend. He always knows and we do not, except when we look and listen to Him.

O Lord, merciful and all-merciful, help all the ignorant, that before death and judgment they may be astonished with great astonishment, and that they too may be saved in the Kingdom of Thy holy ones.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Luke 11:41
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on internal charity
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you"* (Luke 11:41).
</div>
External cleanliness becomes a man. But that is a lesser cleanliness. Internal cleanliness is incomparably more important than external cleanliness. That is a greater cleanliness. A dish can be used only if it is washed and clean on the inside, even though the outside is dark and sooty. If a glass is dirty on the inside, its external cleanliness will never attract anyone to drink from it. If a bowl is dark and ashy on the inside, who will dare to eat from it? In the world there are many more teachers and many examples of external cleanliness than there are of internal cleanliness. For it is easier to teach and demonstrate external cleanliness than internal.

Behold, brethren, how the Teacher and Model of great cleanliness sets this great cleanliness in dependence on internal almsgiving. Almsgiving that is performed from the heart purifies a man's heart. Almsgiving that is performed from the soul cleanses a man's soul. Almsgiving that is performed from the entire mind cleanses a man's mind. In a word, internal almsgiving cleanses the entire man. If almsgiving is only from the hand, it does not cleanse the hand, much less the heart, soul and mind. Almsgiving from the hand is indispensable, but it cleanses the giver only when the heart moves the hand to almsgiving. Besides almsgiving from the hand, there exist other types of almsgiving. Prayer for people is internal almsgiving, as is sorrow for human pain and rejoicing for the joy of others. This is almsgiving which proceeds from the heart and creates cleanliness in the heart, soul and mind.

O All-pure Lord, help us, so that with true almsgiving we may acquire great cleanliness.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Luke 11:42
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
against mediocrity and on fulfilling all the laws of God
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone"* (Luke 11:42).
</div>
The Law and mercy are referred to in this text. In the souls of the Pharisees and sectarians, the Law and mercy do not stand together; that is, they are unable both to fulfill the regulations of the Law and to show mercy—but they argue about which is more important of these two: one they omit and to the other they adhere. The Pharisees observed the letter of the Law literally, but they completely abandoned mercy and love for men. Likewise, sectarians flatter themselves that they adhere to God's justice, but they totally reject the prescriptions of the Church laws.

Orthodoxy represents the fullness of the Faith. The Church commands that we do this, and not omit that. The Church is careful about external prescriptions of the Faith, as a man walking among clay vessels is careful not to break them. The Church is even more careful about the justice and mercy of God, as a man who, walking among the clay vessels, values them and protects them—not because of the earth from which the vessels are made, but because of the priceless contents within them. Empty vessels that are never filled with any drink are as worthless as the empty legal formalisms of the Pharisees. On the other hand, a drink, when poured into the wind, is spilled and wasted, because it is not poured into the vessels designated for it.

And so, in Orthodoxy there is no one-sidedness, as there is none in the Lord Jesus. The Lord says to John the Baptist, who breathes with the justice and mercy of God, that it is necessary to fulfill the Law; but to the Pharisees—empty legalists without the justice and mercy of God—He says: *For it is mercy that I desire, not sacrifice!* (Hosea 6:6). It is evident that that which ye ought to have done is more important than that other that should not be left undone. But it does not mean that what is less important is unnecessary. In the human organism, there are many important organs and many organs of lesser importance, but together they constitute the body of man.

O Lord, all encompassing, do not allow us to become one-sided, but help us to fulfill Thine entire will.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## Luke 12:35
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on danger
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning"* (Luke 12:35).
</div>
This is the commandment of Him Who knows the weaknesses of our being, and Who desires our good more than our father and mother do. This is the commandment of our man-loving Lord. When man is ungirded, does not his entire body droop? When he girds himself, does not his entire body become as erect as a candle? As a candle stands, so must our soul stand, erect before God. How will our souls stand erect before God if unrestrained physical earthly passions and lusts weigh them down? Behold, in the loins is the nest of the main physical passions. To gird one's loins means to tighten oneself with restraint and not to give in to passions at will. But to gird one's physical loins is not the goal, but the means that we utilize to easily gird our mind, our heart and our will. Physical restraint is the primary school of our Christian character; after it comes a higher school, in which we learn restraint of the mind, restraint of the heart and restraint of the will. If we gird our mind, then lustful thoughts will be unable to find a place in its narrowness. If we gird our heart, then lustful desires will be unable to find a place in it. If we gird our will, then the evil, beastly and demonic desires will be unable to find a place in it.

Brethren, by a narrow path can one enter into the Kingdom of God. Only in the narrowness of the mind, the heart and the will, can the candles of the virtues be lighted, the flames of which rise toward God. By the image of the lighted candles, we should understand Christian virtues.

O Lord, pure and sinless, the seat of all virtues, help us to gird ourselves with restraint and to walk the narrow path to Thee with the lighted candles that Thou hast brought into the world.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Luke 13:30
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the reversed values in the Kingdom of God
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first"* (Matthew 19:30; Luke 13:30).
</div>
How all-wise is He Who spoke these words! He did not say that all the first will be last and all the last will be first, but many. There is not one error in the Gospel, and nowhere in the Gospel is there any exaggeration.

Why did the Lord put a limit and not say "all" but rather "many?" Experience teaches us that some of those who were first in honor on earth remained first in honor with God. There have been emperors who pleased God on their thrones, and there have been men without authority who angered God throughout their life.  There have been wealthy men who were saved by their charity and faith, and there have been indigent ones who received condemnation because of their evil and unbelief. There have been learned men who kept the faith and did good deeds, and there have been unlearned men who rejected both faith and good deeds. So there were some who were first here on earth and remained first in heaven, and also there were some who were last here and remained last after death also.

But alas, many who were first here became last there. And oh, the joy, oh, the justice of God—how many who were last here have become first there!

The Lord neither emphasized nor praised one class or one occupation over all others, but He recruited and even today He recruits an army of light from all classes, occupations and professions. For Him the criteria for man is neither a crown nor a beggar's pouch, but rather faith—faith and good deeds.

O All-wise Lord, remember us also in Thy Kingdom.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Luke 16:10,12
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on testing
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.... If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"* (Luke 16:10,12).
</div>
This is how the Householder of both the material and spiritual world speaks. Material wealth He calls "least" and the spiritual wealth He calls "much." If material wealth is given to a person and he proves himself to be selfish, hardhearted, arrogant, unmerciful and godless, then spiritual wealth cannot be given to him. For if he is unfaithful in small things, he will be unfaithful in great things. When he is unfaithful in the physical, he will be unfaithful in the spiritual.

Man undergoes a test in a foreign world, and if he passes the test he will gain his own world.  If, however, he fails the test, who will give him his world? Man's true world, his homeland, is the heavenly, sublime, divine world. The earthly world, however, is the world of coarseness and corruption: a foreign world for man. But man is sent into this foreign world to complete a test for the sake of his true world, his heavenly homeland.

These two statements of the Savior are similar in meaning. Oh, how profound and true is their meaning! Just as light disperses darkness, so do these words of the Savior disperse our confusion in relation to these questions: Why are we sent into this life? And what should we do? To whomever is able to read with a pure understanding, everything is said in these two sentences.

Therefore, let us know that God will not bestow the spiritual gifts—the gifts of understanding, faith, love, purity, prophecy, miracle-working, power over demons, discernment, or the vision of the heavenly world—on him who has gambled and used for evil, like the Prodigal Son, the gifts of bodily health, earthly riches, glory and position among men, or knowledge of the material world.

O Lord most gentle, sustain our fidelity toward Thee in that which Thou hast entrusted to us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Kingdom of God which is within
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"The Kingdom of God is within you"* (Luke 17:21).
</div>

All that belongs to God carries the seal of immortality. And the Kingdom of God is immortal. If we desire to breathe the air of immortality, we must enter within ourselves, within our hearts, within the Kingdom of God. Outside of ourselves is the air of time, the air of transitoriness and decay, in which the soul breathes with difficulty. The kingdom of nature is the sensual kingdom; hence, it is a kingdom foreign to our souls—our souls being of our inner kingdom. Why do men love to reside for a long, long time in a foreign land? Why do they rarely and reluctantly enter into their own home? Whenever we think about the world, we are thinking about that foreign land. Whenever we converse about the sensual world, we are conversing about a foreign land. Living by the senses, we are similar to a man who rushes around all day to the homes of strangers and only at night returns to his own home to sleep. And so we dedicate our waking time to death and our sleep to immortality! We come to ourselves, we return to ourselves only in sleep. But even our sleep is dreaming of our waking life, i.e., even when we are in our own home, in an unconscious state, we dream of foreign homes. Our dreams are sensual, for our consciousness is sensual. And so we are in a foreign land; we are strangers in reality and in dreams. We are constantly outside ourselves. The Lord wants to return us to ourselves, to His home and to His homeland. For us, the Kingdom of God is within us; outside of ourselves is a foreign land. In order to escape from a foreign land and find our true home, in which we directly encounter God, we must enter within ourselves, into our hearts. There is the King; there also is the Kingdom.

O Lord, King of the angels and saints, show us the riches and the light of Thy Kingdom within us, that we may love Thy kingdom more than we love the foreign land of the sensual—the kingdom of change and transitoriness.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

on the good fortune of Zacchaeus of little stature
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
“Today is salvation come to thy house" (Luke 19:9).
</div>
Thus spoke He Whose word is life, joy and the restoration of the righteous. Just as the bleak forest clothes itself in greenery and flowers through the breath of spring, so every man—regardless of how arid and darkened he is by sin—becomes fresh and youthful from the nearness of Christ. For the nearness of Christ is like the closeness of some life-giving and fragrant balsam that restores health, increases life, and gives fragrance to the soul, to the thoughts and to the words of man. In other words, distance from Christ means decay and death, and nearness to Him means salvation and life.

Today is salvation come to thy house, said the Lord upon entering the house of Zacchaeus the sinner. Christ was the salvation that came, and Zacchaeus was the house that He entered. Brethren, each one of us is a house in which sin dwells as long as Christ is distant, and to which salvation comes when Christ approaches. Nevertheless, will Christ approach my house and your house? That depends on us. Behold, He did not arbitrarily enter the house of the sinner Zacchaeus, rather He entered as a most desired guest. Zacchaeus of little stature climbed into a tree in order to see the Lord Jesus with his own eyes. Zacchaeus therefore sought him; Zacchaeus desired Him. We must also seek Him in order to find Him, and desire Him in order that He would draw nearer to us. Then, with our spirit, we must climb high in order to encounter His glance. Then He will visit our house as He visited the house of Zacchaeus, and with Him salvation will come.

Draw near to us, O Lord; draw near and bring to us Thine eternal salvation.

*"Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder"* (Luke 20:18).
</div>
The Lord Christ is the cornerstone. Judas fell on that stone and was smashed. Herod fell on that stone, and he was smashed. Julian the Apostate fell on that stone, and he was smashed. Arius fell on that stone, and he was smashed. Those who deny Christ and those who mock him fall on that stone and are smashed like the clay pots of a potter.

This stone fell on Sodom and Gomorrah, and Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. This stone fell on Egypt, and Egypt was destroyed. This stone fell on Jerusalem, and Jerusalem was destroyed. This stone fell on the Jewish people, and the Jewish people were scattered into pieces. This stone fell on many sinful generations and empires, and those sinful generations and empires dissolved into dust and ashes.

The Lord has forgiven sinners seventy times seven and more, but beyond that, if sinners remain sinners, will the Lord save them against their will? He will not, for that is not the principle of the salvation of men. The principle of salvation is that men voluntarily consent to being saved by God. If men, seventy times seven and more, do not desire to be saved by God, then God will not save them. Then men will be smashed against that stone around which they cannot pass, and they will be destroyed by that stone which they have raised to cast far away from themselves. Can it be said that God, Who saved the penitent thief on the cross, is unmerciful? Can it be said that He is unjust, when He gave over to destruction the thief who mocked Him even in the hour of death?

O Lord Almighty, save us!

Thus speaks He Who knows, He Who has seen, and He Who cannot be deceived. Brethren, what have we to doubt anymore? This testimony is clearer than a summer's noon, harder than diamonds and more precious that all the riches of this world; and this is the testimony: Those who are accounted worthy of that world and resurrection can no longer die, but are immortal like the angels of God.

What are the angels like? Those same angels who appeared at the time of Abraham and came to the aid of men are the same ones who today appear and aid men. They are not dead but alive; they have not grown old but are young. They are the same ones who beheld Adam in Paradise and who will behold the Final Resurrection and the Judgment, and the Kingdom of the saints.

The righteous are similar to angels. The apostles, prophets, saints and martyrs live even today, and will live always and can no longer die. Hundreds and thousands of years pass, but they can neither die nor age anymore; rather they are equal unto the angels.

The Lord testified to us in the above words that the righteous will be crowned with immortality, and He demonstrated this by His own Resurrection, and affirmed it through His glorified saints.

O my brethren, let us awaken and labor—to become worthy to obtain that blessed world!

O resurrected and immortal Lord, help us to become worthy of Thine immortal Kingdom, in which Thou reignest with Thine angels and Thy saints throughout the ages of ages!

All those who love this world more than they love the Eternal Kingdom of God will hate the followers of the Lord Jesus.

All those who love sin more than they love virtue will hate the followers of the Lord Jesus.

The number of those who hate the name of Jesus is sometimes greater and sometimes smaller. However great their number is, brethren, do not be afraid, for the number of angels and saints is myriad. The number of your kinsmen in heaven, i.e., those who love the Lord Jesus, exceeds the number of stars in the firmament and the grains of sand by the sea. Oh, do not be afraid; Christ is with you, and that means that you are always mightier than those who hate you. When the Omnipotent One is on your side, you are always more numerous, for you are always stronger than any number of your adversaries.

on the hand of the betrayer

<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth Me is with Me on the table"* (Luke 22:21).
</div>
It is most difficult for a general to wage war when he has an enemy within the camp—not only external enemies but also internal enemies in his own ranks. Judas was considered among his own. However, he was the enemy from within. Rows of enemies crowded and closed ranks around Christ while Judas was preparing betrayal from within. His hand was on the table that Christ blessed, but his thoughts were aligned with the enemies, where the darkest evil, hatred and malice seethed against the gentle Lord.

Is it not also the same today, that the hands of the many betrayers of Christ are at the table with Him? Which table is not Christ's? What table does not hold His gifts? He is the Householder and He nourishes and feeds His guests. The guests have nothing of their own, nothing! All good and all abundance which is given to them is given by the hand of Christ. Therefore, is not Christ present at every table as a Householder and as a Servant? Therefore, are not the hands of all who betray Christ today at the table with Him? They eat His bread, and they speak against Him. They warm themselves by His sun, and they slander His name. They breathe His air, and they rise up against His Church. They live by His mercy, and they banish Him from their homes, their schools, their courts, their books and their hearts. They willfully and maliciously trample His commandments and ridicule His law. Are they not the betrayers of Christ and the followers of Judas? Do not be afraid of them! God did not command us to be afraid of them, but to wait to see their end. Our Lord was not afraid of Judas nor is He afraid of all the traitorous hordes to the end of time. He knows their end, and He already has His victory in His hands. Therefore, neither should you be afraid. Adhere faithfully to Christ the Lord, not only when it appears that His work is succeeding and advancing in the world, but also when it appears that His work is failing and perishing. Do not be afraid! If you become frightened, perhaps your hand will be found clenched beneath Judas's hand at the table of Christ.

## Luke 23:12
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the reconciliation of the wicked for the sake of evil
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves"* (Luke 23:12).
</div>
In His shame and humiliation, the Just One does good to His enemies. He reconciles them. It is true, in this case, that their reconciliation did not create mutual cooperation for some good deed but mutual persecution of the Just One. At least the flame of hatred between them was extinguished and died out. That was due to the Just One. Pilate and Herod were enemies. On that day when the Savior was brought for judgment before both of them, they were reconciled. The Prince of Peace brought peace between the quarreling parties: peace which helped to hew out a cross for Him. But He also came to be a willing sacrifice for the sins of many.

Even today common enemies make peace among themselves when they find it necessary to attack and condemn the Lord. There are many who kill one another until you mention the name of the Lord to them. As soon as they hear that name, they gradually make peace among themselves for the sake of attacking that holy name. It is easier for the unjust to tolerate the unjust than it is for them to tolerate the just. It is easier for the unjust to come to an understanding and reconcile with the unjust than with the just.

In some countries, even the most quarrelsome parties seek reconciliation among themselves when it is deemed necessary to decide what place should be given to the Lord Jesus Christ in the state—the first place, which is befitting to Him, or the last place? Over these questions sworn enemies reconcile themselves, so that our Lord will be given the last place. So, also it was with the quarreling parties of Pharisees and Saducees, who were reconciled and entered into a partnership against Christ.

Why is it that the Most-pure and the Most-needed had to be awarded the last place? Because, according to their thinking, the first place would then be reserved for them. The same incentive was there between sworn enemies, the Pharisees and Saducees, when it was deemed necessary to seek Christ's death. The same incentive was the occasion that caused the reconciliation between Pilate and Herod when it was deemed necessary to judge that Christ had to be put to death.

O my brethren, let us never seek peace with the unjust against justice. Rather, let us always seek peace with God, and that with a clear conscience.

O God, help us so that we may always possess such a peace.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Luke 24:5

on seeking the living among the dead
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Why seek ye the living among the dead?"* (Luke 24:5).
</div>
The angel of God asks the myrrh-bearing women, as though in astonishment: "Why seek ye the living among the dead?" As though the perceiver of the mystery of God and God's power wanted to say: "How could you have thought for a moment that He is the hostage of death? Do you not know that He is the principal source of life? Do you not know that all life is through Him and that not one living thing can borrow even a drop of life from any other source? Did He not, on earth, reveal to you fully His authority over life and death? Who gave life to the lifeless Lazarus? Who took away the life of the barren fig tree?"

O my brethren, let us also cease to look for the living among the dead. If there are some of us who are still seeking Christ among the dead, let them desist from this soul-destroying effort. This is the vain effort of the Jews, pagans and non-Christians. We know that the Lord and Giver of Life is not in the tomb but on the Throne of Glory in the heavens. The spirit not darkened by sin looks up into heaven and does not see the tomb; while the spirit darkened by sin looks into the tomb and does not see heaven. Sin and virtue, at cross purposes with each other, govern the spiritual vision of a man—each revealing to man its own world. Sin brings the vision of the spirit down to the earth and reveals to it the corruption of the world. Virtue uplifts the spirit to heaven and reveals to it the eternal world, and the resurrected Christ as the King in that world.

O my brethren, let us not seek life from creation, but from the Creator. Let us not commit an even graver sin: let us not seek the Creator in the tomb of creation or the Illuminating, Immortal One in the darkness of death.

O Lord Jesus, Victor over death, we cry out to Thee: raise us up also into life eternal from the corruption and darkness of death.

*"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name"* (Luke 24:47).
</div>
This is the final instruction of the Savior to the holy apostles. In these words, as in a nutshell, is contained the Gospel of reconciliation between God and men. What does God seek from men and what does God give them? He seeks repentance, and He grants forgiveness of sins. He seeks little, but He gives all. Let men only repent for sins committed and cease sinning, and men will receive all from God—all, not only all that their hearts could desire, but even more, much more. In truth, everything is promised to the righteous. The righteous will be the inheritors of the Kingdom of God, they will be the sons of God, and they will be the children of light, the children of immortality, companions of the angels, brothers of Christ. The righteous will have an abundance of life, peace, wisdom, power, and joy. The righteous will have all, for all has been promised to them.

Let men only repent, and they will receive all. Let the beggar only cleanse himself, bathe himself and clothe himself in purity before the doors of the royal court, and he will be immediately ushered into the royal court. There he will be met and embraced by the King, and he will have all. He will live with the King, and sit at the royal table; he will have all, all, all!

O my brethren, these are not only words, rather this is the living and holy truth. For we know that many penitents, both female and male, received all of this that was promised. Many have appeared from the other world and have proved the truth of these words, witnessing to how they now live as royal sons and daughters. But they repented in time; and there yet remains time for us to repent, if we desire to be together with them as the heirs of the Kingdom.

O Merciful Lord, help us to repent before death, in order that we may live eternally.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 2:19
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Church as the Body of the Lord
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"* (John 2:19).
</div>
Thus spoke the Lord to the wicked Jews about *the temple of His body* (John 2:21). But since it is not given to the wicked to understand anything, so also the Jews did not understand and mocked Him. The Lord did not rebuke them for that, but that which He spoke occurred. The Jews destroyed His body, but He restored it again and raised it in glory and power. The wicked punished God with destruction, but God reprimanded the wicked by restoration. It is satisfying to the wicked ones to be able to show their power by killing, but for God there is joy in showing His power by giving life. There is nothing as short-lived as the triumph of evil nor anything as lasting as the triumph of truth.

*Destroy this temple.* The Lord referred to His body as the Church. Destroyed, that Church was crowded into a dark tomb, and a heavy stone prevented light from penetrating to it. But that Church was not in need of the light of the sun. It had its own light, its own Sun of Righteousness, Who shone from within. A gentle heavenly hand removed the stone from the tomb and the Lord resurrected in glory and in power. That which once happened to the All-pure Body of Christ occurred many times later to the Church of the holy ones on earth.

The enemies of the Church cruelly persecuted and tormented it, demolished it and buried it in darkness. But the Church, after such bruises and confinement, resurrected again with greater glory and power. Just as the Church of His Body resurrected, so at the end of time the Church of His holy ones will resurrect in fullness and perfection.

O resurrected Lord, do not give us over to decay and eternal death, but resurrect us to life eternal.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 2:19
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the power of Him Who resurrects the body
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"* (John 2:19).
</div>
Here the Lord speaks about the temple of His body. Destroy this body and in three days I will raise it up! Thus speaks One Who knows His might and Who, according to His might, fulfilled His words. For His body was destroyed, broken, pierced, buried and covered with darkness for three days. And on the third day He raised it: raised it not only from the grave on earth but raised it up to the heavens. And so He spoke the word and His word came to pass.

The Lord gave a sign to the Jews, for they sought a sign from Him. And when He gave them a sign, such as no one else before Him had been able to give, they did not believe Him. Instead, confused and frightened, they bribed the guards from Golgotha to swear falsely and to proclaim the lie that this miraculous sign had not occurred, and that His disciples had stolen His body from the tomb!

No sign whatsoever helps those who do not want to believe. With their own eyes, the Jews witnessed the many miracles of Christ; but nevertheless they did not want to believe. They justified their unbelief, saying that He (performed these miracles through the prince of the devils* (Matthew 9:34). Whoever does not want to believe in good, all the signs that heaven can give will not help him. A heart filled with evil is harder than granite. A mind darkened by sin cannot be illuminated by all the light of heaven, whose light is greater than a thousand suns.

When man expels evil from his heart and delivers his mind from the darkness of sin, then he sees the numerous signs that God gives to those who want to believe—who see and believe.

O my brethren, let us not sin against the mercy of God and let us not succumb to the evil of the Jews. O my brethren, all the signs have already been given, and they all glitter as the stars in the heavenly firmament upon all who have a good heart and a right-thinking mind.

O Wonderworking Lord, to Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## John 3:18
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on judgment and condemnation
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already"* (John 3:18).
</div>
He who believes in Christ the Lord is not condemned, for he judges himself, and directs his footsteps toward the light that goes before him. As a man in profound darkness adjusts his footsteps according to the candle in his hand, so does the one who believes in Christ—he has embarked after Christ as after a light in the darkness of life.

He who does not believe is condemned already. That is, he who does not have a guide on the unknown path loses his way and strays as soon as he takes the first step. He who does not believe in Christ is condemned to ignorance, weakness, anger, staggering along crooked and winding roads, vice, despair and perhaps even suicide. He is condemned in two worlds: in this world to a senseless, physical and delusory existence, and in the other world to eternal damnation! Oh, how dark is the path of the children of unbelief, and how deep is the abyss between their first and third steps!

O All-merciful Lord, in truth, besides Thee we have no one and nothing to believe in. Thou art our Savior from darkness, sin and death.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 4:34
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on perfection through the fulfilling of the will of God
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Jesus saith unto them, 'My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work'"* (John 4:34).
</div>
Here is a saving example given to us by our Savior! He Who had such power, authority and wisdom says that He came into the world to do not His own will but the will of the Father, and to do not His own work but the work of His Father—but we, even though we are as weak as a cobweb, continuously emphasize our will and, some of us, even our work! The Son is equal to the Father, as He says in another place: I am my Father are one (John 10:30). Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus says that He came into the world to do His Father's will and to accomplish His Father's will. He is not saying this in order show the smallness of His being before the Father's being—for Their being is one—but, rather, to show the greatness of His love toward the Father, and in order to motivate us, out of love toward God, to totally adopt His will.

All of our misery in this life comes from the fact that we do not implement the will of Him Who sent us into this world. We do not implement His will because we do not have love toward Him. For whoever loves someone acts according to his will. The Lord Himself said: If ye love Me, keep My commandments (John 14:15). By what means could the Lord proclaim His love toward the Father, if not by fulfilling the will of the Father? And by what means can we proclaim our love toward the Lord Jesus, crucified for us on the Cross, if not by fulfilling His will?

Our will, O my brethren, is as deceitful as a shadow. Let us not follow it, that we may not perish. Rather, let us follow the will of the Lover of mankind, the Lord, Who alone knows what is best for us.

O humble and man-loving Lord, teach us to do Thy will.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 5:36
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the works of Christ
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For the works which the Father hath given Me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father hath sent Me"* (John 5:36).
</div>
Brethren, what are these works of Christ? These are the works of the Householder Who returned from a journey and found the home robbed and desolate. These are the works of the Physician Who entered into the most contaminated hospital, brought medicines and began to heal. Furthermore, these are the works of the King Who returned to his country and found it divided and ruined, and His subjects as slaves in a strange land. These are the works of the Elder Brother Who journeyed to a distant land to seek His younger brother who, wandering and prodigal, had become impoverished and wild. These are also the works of the Healer, Shepherd, Hero and Provider. Truly, these are not minor works! An ordinary man with the greatest worldly knowledge, skill and courage would not be able to accomplish even in three thousand years those works which Christ completed in three years. Not only one man, but all men of all times together, would not be able to complete the works of Christ in all eternity.

How did the Lord accomplish so many works? He accomplished them with the aid of five main miracles: His humility, His words, His deeds, His blood, and His resurrection.

What do the works of Christ witness? The works witness first of all that the earth did not send Him, but heaven; second, that an angel did not send Him, but the Heavenly Father Himself; third, that for such works no one is sufficient except Him Who is as great as God, as wise as God, as almighty as God, as merciful as God—yes, Who is Himself equal to God.

Oh, how insignificant are all of our works compared to the works of Christ! With only one grain of Christ's goodness and zeal, diligence and truthfulness, we can complete our work perfectly. Grant us that grain, O Lord Jesus, for we on earth can neither find this grain nor merit it.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 6:48
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the nourishment of the soul
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"I am that Bread of Life"* (John 6:48).
</div>
Thus spoke the Lord Jesus to the hungry human race. These words have been proved throughout the centuries to Christ's innumerable followers, who have received the Lord as the nourishment of their souls. A desperate young man who was close to suicide confessed to a spiritual father. The spiritual father listened to him carefully and said to him: "My son, you are to blame for your misfortune. Your soul is starved to death. Throughout your entire life, you learned only how to nourish your body, but you never thought that the soul requires greater and more frequent nourishment than the body. Your soul is on the verge of dying from hunger. My son, eat and drink Christ [Holy Communion]. Only this can restore your soul from death. Every day eat and drink of Christ. He is the Life-creating Bread of our souls." The young man obeyed the elder and returned to life.

Brethren, let us nourish our souls with Christ, that our souls may be alive and healthy. Let us continually nourish our minds with Christ's thoughts, that our minds might be enlightened and clear. Let us continually nourish our hearts with the love of Christ, that our hearts might be full and joyful. Let us continually nourish our wills with the commandments of Christ and the example of Christ, that our wills might perform good deeds every minute. Let Christ's thoughts be our thoughts and Christ's love be our love and Christ's good will be our good will. Let us continually nourish our souls with Christ the Lord; with our soul let us continually eat Him and drink Him! There is no more nourishing Bread than He; there is no sweeter drink than He. In Holy Communion, He gives Himself completely to us, Body and Blood. But Holy Communion is a reminder that our souls must continually be nourished by Him, continually eat Him and drink Him just as we continually breathe.

O our good and sweet Lord, stir up our souls that they may continually nourish themselves with Thee and remain alive. Thou art our Bread of Life.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 7:17
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on understanding through doing
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself"* (John 7:17).
</div>
It benefits little to prove by human logic and words that the teaching of Christ is the teaching from God. The fastest and most reliable way to know that this is truth is to do the will of God in the same way that Christ proclaimed it and testified to it. Whoever does this will know that the teaching of Christ is the teaching from God.

If you weep for the sake of God, you will know what a comfort He is. If you are merciful, you will know the mercy of God. If you build peace, you will know how it becomes you to be called a son of God. If you forgive men, you will know that God forgives you.

No one can ever know that the teaching of Christ is the teaching from God, except he who does the will of God. Doing the will of God and fulfilling His commandments is the only key for unlocking Paradise, in which God is seen. That is the key for understanding Holy Scripture and all the mysteries of revelation.

St. Basil writes: "In order to understand that which is hidden in Sacred Scripture, purity of life is needed."

What else does the Lord want from us, when He teaches us that through doing His will we arrive at the understanding of the divinity of His teaching? He simply wishes that we, by [the fruit of] our deeds, become convinced of the divinity of His teaching. He does not desire that we be convinced of this in an easy manner, but rather in a more difficult manner—not only by listening, but by doing, because whoever is convinced in an easy manner will easily waver and change his mind; and as for him who is convinced in a difficult manner, it would be difficult for him to change his mind. Brethren, that is why we must endeavor to fulfill the will of God, in order that we may know God and save our souls.

O Lord, all-wise, help us by the power of Thy Holy Spirit to do Thy will.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 7:29
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the mutual knowledge of the Father and the Son
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"I know Him, for I am from Him, and He hath sent Me"* (John 7:29).
</div>
No one has ever dared say that he knows God. Many have merely said that they believe in God. Only our Lord Jesus Christ spoke the words I know Him. And immediately He explained from where He knows Him, saying: For I am from Him, and He hath sent Me. The first reason: I am from Him, testifies to the eternal being of the Son; and the second reason, and He hath sent Me, testifies to the manifestation of the Son in time, in the physical world, as an emissary of the Holy Trinity.

For us who are Christ-believing, it is not given to know the Father as His Only-begotten Son knows Him. To us it is given and commanded that we believe. Our merit is in believing and not in knowing. If all of us knew God by seeing, no one would have any merit. For what kind of merit is there in seeing and recognizing? However, not to see and yet to believe—in this there is merit, in this there is virtue, in this is our salvation. We are not worthy to see God and by seeing Him to know Him, for we are weakened by sin and alienated from God. But the mercy of God gives us faith while in this life, which is able to bring us closer to God and lead us into the Eternal Kingdom of seeing and knowing in the life to come. O my brethren, let us believe in Christ the Lord, for He knows. He does not speak by faith but by knowing.

O Merciful Lord, strengthen our faith. Extend the hem of Thy garment that we may hold onto it to the end of our lives.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 7:31
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the believing people and the unbelieving elders
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?"* (John 7:31).
</div>
The Lord Jesus performed miraculous works before all, and all saw but not all believed. The people witnessed His miracles and believed in Him. Servants heard His words and believed in Him. However, the leaders of the people and the masters of the servants also witnessed His miracles and did not believe in Him. And so in those days the words of the Savior came true: *But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first* (Matthew 19:30). Those who were first in honor and authority were last in having faith in Him, and those who were last in honor and authority were the first in having faith in Him.

Why did the people and servants believe, and the princes and scribes not believe? Because the people and servants considered themselves insignificant and unimportant and had neither personal pride nor envy toward Christ. The people and servants, without malice and prejudice, looked upon the divine miracles, listened to the divine words, and were amazed and rejoiced. The princes and the scribes considered themselves first among the people and in the world, and so they were filled with pride and envy.  They were unable, even for a moment, to look upon the miraculous works or to listen to the divine words without malice and envy.

Brethren, do you see how a man, without humility and meekness, is unable to recognize truth or to rejoice in the truth? Do you see how the proud and the envious do not allow God to have precedence over them? This is just what Satan once did!

Lord Jesus, Eternal Truth, cleanse our hearts of pride and envy, that we may be able to see Thee and rejoice in Thee.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## John 8:12
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the only Light in darkness
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"I am the Light of the world"* (John 8:12).
</div>

Since the beginning of the world and time, no one who was ever born has dared to speak these words. There have been men, and there are men, who say: "I bring light!" But only one dared to say: "I am the Light!" Only the Lord Jesus could have spoken those words boldly and convincingly. His short life on earth and His long history of nearly two thousand years have completely justified these words. He is the Light of truth, righteousness and life.

He is the Light of truth, because He revealed in Himself the truth of the true nature of God and the true nature of man, the relationship of man to man, and the relationship of man toward God. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but His words will not pass away; for heaven and earth both came into existence by His word, and His word is from Him and with Him always, and will not pass away. *[Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away* (Matthew 24:35 - Mark 13:31)].

He is the Light of righteousness, because He revealed the might of righteousness and the weakness of unrighteousness. He revealed this in the brightest light—by what He said, by what He did, and by what He experienced—and overcame the unrighteous ones. He has revealed it through His Church over the course of twenty centuries—through His numerous righteous saints and martyrs, for righteousness' sake. Righteousness is from God, and in the long line of history, it can never be defeated. Unrighteousness is of helpless beings. Unrighteousness quickly rushes out to the rampart with its triumphant banner, but at the same time, it is quickly thrown into the grave.

He is the Light of life. His words illuminate life. His works illuminate life. His victory illuminates life. Especially His resurrection, as the most luminous sun, illuminates life by its bright light and disperses death as a weak shadow.

O Lord Jesus, Light Most-luminous, Sun of Truth, Sun of Righteousness and Sun of Life, illuminate us sinners and unworthy ones!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 8:15
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on judging according to the flesh and according to the spirit
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Ye judge after the flesh"* (John 8:15).
</div>
Thus spoke the Omniscient Lord to the wicked Jews: Ye judge after the flesh. They had caught a woman in adultery and wanted to stone her because of her fleshly sin. But the Lord, perceiving the soul of the woman and seeing that she could still be saved and changed, brought her to repentance and released her. For even though she committed the act of adultery, her soul was not totally adulterous. The Pharisees, on the other hand, constantly bore the sin of adultery in their hearts, but they skillfully concealed that sin. They did not condemn adultery in the heart, but only the act of fleshly adultery of those whom they caught doing this.

Spiritual men judge by the spirit and physical men judge by the flesh. Even today, the Jews, punished and dispersed throughout the whole world, are unable to think spiritually and judge spiritually. They still think and judge only by the flesh and only externally, according to the ordinances of the law written on paper or in nature, but still never according to the spirit. For if they had learned to judge men and deeds according to the spirit, they would have immediately recognized the Lord Jesus as the Messiah and Savior.

Let us be on guard, O Christians, that we judge not only according to the flesh. Let us be on guard that we be not too quick to judge him who, because of his ineptness, slips into misdeeds; nor to praise him who behaves skillfully and does not slip before men, but who with his heart is already completely in the abyss of sin. Let us be on guard from error, that we not judge men and nature according to sensual impressions but strive to judge everything spiritually, that is, by the spirit. Behold, we are the children of the spirit and light, for we are baptized.

O Lord Jesus, teach us and guide us, that we neither think nor judge according to the flesh, but rather by the spirit.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## John 8:25
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Man Whom no one knows
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Who are Thou?" Jesus said to them: "The beginning..."* (John 8:25).
</div>
The Lord Jesus is the beginning of creation, the beginning of restoration, the beginning of salvation, the beginning of resurrection, and the beginning of immortal glory.

Wherever there is any evil in the world that needs to be uprooted, He is the beginning. Without Him it is impossible. Wherever there is any good that is desired to be done in the world, He is the beginning. Without Him it is impossible. If anyone desires to uproot dissent and malice in a family, in a village, in a town, in the entire world, without Him it is impossible. One must begin with Him. If anyone desires to instill good will, peace, love and unity in a family, in a village, in a town, among the peoples in the entire world, without Him it is impossible. He is the beginning.

Why is it that one cannot uproot evil or sow good without Christ? Because all evil is from sin, and only He can forgive sins. When He (and only He) forgives sin, then sin is plucked out by the root. No manner of good is possible to be sown without Him, because in Him is the treasury of all good—all the seeds of good. He is the only Sower of Good in the field of the world.

The Apostle Paul, who understood all of this better than we, said: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me (Philippians 4:13). Without Jesus Christ, who can begin to heal himself of evil, to heal others from evil, to sow good in himself and to sow good in others? No one, truly no one.

Therefore, brethren, if we are determined to uproot evil in ourselves and in others, and in place of evil to sow good in ourselves and in others, let us begin with the Beginning—that is, let us begin with the Conqueror over evil and the Sower of good, with the Lord Jesus Christ.

O Lord Jesus Christ, be Thou to us the Beginning in every struggle against sin and in every good work.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 8:37
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the narrow-minded, to whom crime is closer than the love of God
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But ye seek to kill Me, because My word hath no place in you"* (John 8:37).
</div>
Why was the word of Christ unable to prevail among the Jewish elders? Because, they were so filled with malice that there was no room in them for the divine seed, for the divine good news. All that grew in their souls was the sowing of Satan, the Antichrist. That is why they sought to kill Christ. Through the blessed Psalmist, the Lord speaks: Empty yourselves, and know that I am God (Psalm 46:10). Therefore, it is necessary to empty oneself of everything that is opposed to God, i.e., of everything in us that hinders the light of the knowledge of God from dwelling in us. When man empties himself of that, then and only then can he understand that God is God. As long as the soul of a man is filled with ungodly thoughts, ungodly feelings and ungodly desires, man is totally unable to listen to or receive the word of God. When people do not have God within themselves, they act by some infernal impulse to uproot God from the soul of him who possesses Him. Ye seek to kill Me. Why? Because not one divine word of Christ was able to find shelter or acceptance in their godless hearts. Having nothing in common with Christ the Lord, the Jewish elders, from the beginning, were unable to have any kind of friendly relations with Him.

O Lord Jesus, our Blessed Savior, help us to empty ourselves of all sinful seeds, that Thy holy word may be able to enter into us and to enlighten, strengthen and resurrect us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 8:52
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the word of God, which is mightier than death
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death"* (John 8:52).
</div>
As long as a candle burns in a room there will not be darkness, for the candle emits light. If food is seasoned with salt, it will be preserved from spoiling. If someone keeps the word of Christ in his soul, that one keeps salt and light in his soul, and life will abide in him. Such a soul will not become dark in this life, neither will it taste the decay of death.

Whoever keeps the word of Christ in himself, the word of Christ sustains him from within and feeds, enlightens and enlivens him. Whether he is in the body or outside the body, he feels equally alive by means of the word of Christ. Death can separate his soul from his body, but not from Christ, i.e., from immortal and eternal life. The death of his body will only give his life-bearing soul a freer flight in embracing the beloved Christ the Life-giver.

But what does it mean, brethren, to keep the word of Christ within ourselves? It means, first, to keep the word of Christ in our minds, thinking about it; second, to keep the word of Christ in our hearts, loving it; third, to keep the word of Christ in our wills, fulfilling it in deeds; and fourth, to keep the word of Christ on our tongues, openly confessing it when necessary. Thus, to keep the word of Christ means to fill ourselves with it and to fulfill it. Whoever keeps the word of Christ in this manner, truly, will never taste of death.

O our Lord, Mighty Lord, mightier than death, give us strength and understanding to keep Thy holy word to the end—that we do not taste of death and that death does not taste of us, and that decay not touch our souls. O All-merciful Lord, be merciful to us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 9:41
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the sin of those who assert that they can see
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"If ye were blind, ye should have no sin"* (John 9:41).
</div>
These words were spoken to the Jews by Him Who gave them the Law through the prophets, that the Law might serve them as the sight of the soul. The Jews received that sight, but they intentionally and evilly shut their eyes. That is why the righteous Lord spoke these righteous words to them.

These are words of true justice, yesterday and today and forever, for a blind man has no sin if he tramples upon someone else's crop or if he takes someone else's garment instead of his own. If he who has sight commits this, he will be committing a sin and will incur punishment. If he who has eyes intentionally closes his eyes and does this, he also will be committing a sin and will incur punishment.

Nevertheless, what can be said about those who have received baptism and chrismation, the two eyes of the soul, and still sin as those who are unbaptized? At the Last Judgment, they will not be treated as those who are born blind, rather they will be judged as transgressors who have willfully disfigured and blinded themselves.

And what can be said about those who receive the other Mysteries of grace in the fullness of Orthodoxy, having before them the examples of the saints, and constantly listening to the warnings and admonitions of God's Church, but who nevertheless depart and go astray? At the Last Judgment such people will not be able to justify themselves by any type of blindness; rather they will be judged as transgressors who have disfigured themselves and others around them with blindness.

O Awesome Lord, save us from sin. O Merciful Lord, open our eyes to the path of salvation.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## John 11:11
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on death as sleeping
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep"* (John 11:11).
</div>
The Lord of life calls death sleep. Oh, what an inexpressible comfort that is for us! Oh, what sweet news for the world! Physical death, therefore, does not mean the annihilation of man, but merely a sleep from which only He can wake man—He Who woke the first dust to life by His word.

When the Lord cried out, *"Lazarus!"* (John 11:43), the man awoke and lived. The Lord knows the name of each of us. If Adam knew the names of every creature of God, why would not the Lord know each one of us by name? Not only does He know, but He also calls us by name. Oh, the sweet and life-creating voice of the only Lover of mankind! This voice can create sons of God from stones. Why, then, can He not rouse us out of our sinful sleep?

It is told that a certain man raised a stone to kill his brother, but at that moment it seemed to him that he heard the voice of his mother calling him by name. He merely heard the voice of his mother, and his hand began to quiver. He dropped the stone and was ashamed of his evil intention. The voice of his mother woke him from committing a deadly sin. If the voice of a mother saves and awakens from death, how much more does the voice of the Creator and Life-giver!

Whenever the Lord cried out to someone who was physically dead, the person awoke and arose. But not everyone among those who were spiritually dead awoke and arose when the Lord cried out to them. For this awakening, for this resurrection, the agreement of the will of the deceased is necessary. *Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?* (Luke 22:48). That is how the life-creating voice cried out, but the dead man [Judas] remained dead, and the sinner did not awaken. *Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?* (Acts of the Apostles 9:4). The same life-creating voice cried out and he who was asleep in sin awoke, and the dead man came to life. In truth, deeper is the sleep of sin than the sleep of death, and the one who is asleep in sin does not easily awaken.

O Sweet Lord, wake us from the sleep of sin; wake us, O Lord!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 12:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the struggle of the weak with the Almighty
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death"* (John 12:10).
</div>
They agreed among themselves to first kill the Maker and then kill His work. For the risen Lazarus was the work of Christ. What is the use, they iniquitously thought, to kill the Miracle-worker and to leave a living witness of His greatest miracle? For then the people would be inflamed at them as evildoers! But, nevertheless, it happened that they killed Christ and missed Lazarus. And then? And then they and those of like mind killed scores of His apostles and overlooked hundreds. Then they killed thousands and overlooked hundreds of thousands. Then they killed hundreds of thousands and overlooked millions. Finally it became clear that, behind their backs, the slain were resurrecting to life like mown grass and those designated to be killed grew as sown grass before the faces of the murderers. In vain, from their point of view, did the wise Gamaliel say: *But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it* (Acts 5:39). Those who wage war against God throughout the centuries have sharpened their feebleness in vain to mow down the crop of God. The more they cut down, the more the crops of God grew luxuriantly.

O demented combatants against Christ, those of that time and the present! Your bludgeon rebounds from the city of Christ and strikes your own hovel, crushing it into dust and ashes. Throughout the ages, you have had enough allies: besides the devil, with you were heretics, idolaters, fanatics, soothsayers, divinators, depraved princes and wealthy men, tyrants and all insensitive sinners. Up to now you have been defeated, and without any doubt all of your allies together with you will be defeated, to the end of time.

For this, O almighty and irresistible Lord, glory and praise be to Thee forever. Amen.


## John 12:24
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the need to die in order to bring forth much fruit
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit"* (John 12:24).
</div>
Why does the sower cast wheat upon the ground? Does he do this so that the wheat will die and rot? No, he does this so that it will live and bear fruit. In sowing the seed, the sower does not think about the death and decay of the seed, but rather about its life and yield. Indeed, with joy does the sower sow his seed, not thinking about the death of the seed, but rather about life and fruitfulness.

The Sower is Christ the Lord and men are His wheat. He was pleased to call us wheat. There are many other types of seed on earth, but nothing is more precious than wheat. Why did the Lord sow us throughout the world? So that we should die and decay? No, rather that we should live and bring forth fruit. He alludes to our death incidently. He alludes to death only as a condition for life and multiple yield. The goal of sowing is not death but life. The seed must first die and decay, and He mentions this only in passing because He knows we are fully aware of it. He only reminds us incidently of this, as His Gospel is primarily a narrative of life—about life and about bringing forth good fruit. He speaks to us a great deal about the latter because He knows we are not aware of it and that we are suffocating from ignorance and doubt. Not only does He speak to us abundantly about life, but He also shows us life. By His Resurrection, He demonstrates to us, more clearly than the sun, life and the multitude of fruit. The entire history of His Church is a clear map of life.

O invincible Lord of Life, save us from a sinful death. Deliver us from spiritual death.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## John 12:45
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Father and the Son
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And he that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me"* (John 12:45).
</div>
He who sees the light also sees the sun beyond it. For could anyone see the sun and not the light? If the sun did not emit its light, none of us would know about the sun. All of our knowledge about the sun we have received with the help of the rays of light that have come from the sun. No one has ever seen the sun with the help of some other light, other than that which comes from the sun itself.

So it is with our knowing the Father with the help of the Son. He who does not know the Son cannot know the Father. He who knows the Son, knows the Father. He who sees the Son, sees also the Father. God cannot be known without His Light, Who came among men. The Light of the Father is the Son. *I am the Light* (John 8:2), said Christ. *And the Light shineth in darkness* (John 1:5). The physical world would be in complete darkness if it were not for the light from the sun. The spiritual and moral world and all the life of mankind would be in darkness if it were not for the Light that is from the Father. That Light is Christ the Lord.

Truly, brethren, there is no true light which illuminates the Being of God as does the Light of Christ the Lord. He who sees Him sees God. He who does not see Him is in darkness.

O Lord, Son of God, always help our souls to see Thee, and through Thee, Thy Heavenly Father and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in Essence and undivided.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 13:17
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on knowing and doing
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them"* (John 13:17).
</div>
The most important aspect of this saying of our Lord's, dear brethren, is that the Lord does not bless the knowing, but the doing. He does not say to the apostles: "Blessed are ye when ye know this." Some pagan teachers who viewed salvation only in terms of knowledge spoke in this manner. However, our Lord says: Blessed are ye if ye do them. The knowledge of salvation was given to us by the Lord Jesus Himself, and no one is able to attain that knowledge through his own efforts. Some of the ancient Greek philosophers said that mankind could neither come to the knowledge of the truth nor be saved until God Himself came to earth. The Lord came among men and revealed this knowledge to them. Whosoever receives this knowledge also accepts the obligation to fulfill it. Oh, how much easier will it be at the Judgment for those who never received this knowledge at all and consequently did not fulfill it, than for those who received this knowledge and neglected to fulfill it!  Oh, how much easier it will be at the Judgment for unlearned pagans than for the learned Christians!

The Lord Himself showed that he was not only a Knower but also as a Doer. His perfect knowledge corresponded to His perfect doing. Before the eyes of His disciples, He personally fulfilled all of His own commandments. He gave them this commandment after He had completed an act of humility and love. When He had washed the feet of His disciples. He then commanded that they should do the same to one another.

The Lord did not dwell among men to soil them, but to wash them. He never soiled anyone, but cleansed all who wished to be cleansed. What a shame it is for many of us, who labor much to wash ourselves and labor twice as much to soil others? O my brethren, we muddy our own blood brothers. Even Christ weeps when He sees how we, with the mud of slander, soil those whom He has washed with His own blood.

O Lord, forgive us! We sin every day against our own brothers. O Lord, make our brothers, whom we have soiled, brighter than us in Thy Kingdom. Thou art just and Thou seest all.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 15:3
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the Word of God which purifies as a fire
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you"* (John 15:3).
</div>
By His Word the Lord created the world; by His Word He renewed the world; by His Word He forgave sins; by His Word He healed diseases; by His Word He drove out evil spirits; by His Word He calmed the storms and the winds. By His holy Word He cleanses men even now, so that they, having been cleansed, may bring forth abundant fruit. Vines, when they are pruned and cleansed, are strong. The Word of the Lord is powerful, for it comes forth from the Almighty. *By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made* (Psalm 33:6). The Word of the Lord is as bright as the sun; but, when necessary, it is as fiery as the sun and burns up everything that goes against the Lord. The Word of the Lord is as sweet as honey; but, when necessary, it is as bitter as medicine. The Word of the Lord is as welcome as a friend who knocks at the door when he is most needed; but, when necessary, the Word of the Lord is as a judge who finds us in sin and who judges us without allowing any excuse. The Word of the Lord is true, just, wise and merciful, which is why it is so all-powerful. No one and nothing, either in heaven or on earth, is able to oppose it. The human word is also powerful when it is true, just, wise and merciful. But just as illness is able to exhaust and so weaken a giant that he becomes more powerless than a child, so also falsehoods, injustice, insanity and lack of mercy so weaken the word of a man that it becomes nothing: a fox chattering against the moon. He who spares words forges them of pure silver. But whoever relentlessly squanders them mixes earth with the silver.

Thy word, O Lord, is life and truth. Cleanse us by Thine almighty Word, as Thou didst cleanse Thine apostles, that we may bear much fruit and be made worthy of Thy Kingdom.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 15:5
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
**on our helplessness without Christ the Lord**
</div>
<br/>
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For without Me ye can do nothing"* (John 15:5)
</div>
Our Lord did not have the habit of exaggerating in His speech. No words in this world are weighed more than His words. When He says that we can do nothing without Him, this must be taken and understood literally. Here, He speaks of good and not of evil. We can do no good without Christ, aside from Christ or contrary to Christ. He is the Proprietor, the Giver and the Inspirer of all good. No type of good stands outside Him; likewise, no type of evil is contained in Him. Our Lord said: *I am the Vine, ye are the branches* (John 15:5). What can the branches do without the Vine? Can they grow and bring forth fruit? No, they can do nothing but become firewood.

Man can think as hard as he wants, but he cannot conceive of one true good that is not in Christ and that does not stem from Christ. If someone were to say that he does good and humane works outside of Christ, know that his works are spoiled to the core and corroded, be it from vanity or from hidden selfishness. Man without Christ is the same as branches without the vine. He Himself told us this. The Vine is hidden and unseen, but the branches are seen. Nevertheless, the grapes on the branch and the branch itself depend on the Vine. The Vine of all-encompassing good grows from the heart of God the Father and is watered by the sweetness of the Holy Spirit. O Triune Lord God, have mercy on us and save us!

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 16:28
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the wondrous visit of the Son of God
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father"* (John 16:28).
</div>
Brethren, these words are of crucial importance for us.  For of all things in this world, this is the most important to know: Is there a God and is there life after death?  These words are more precious than all the pearls in the world, more precious than the sun and more precious than the stars, for these words were spoken by Him Who is the most reliable and the most truthful Witness.  In truth, these words are the source of the greatest joy for us who are plunged into despair and, after despair, face death.  These words witness that there is a God and that there is life after death.  I came forth from the Father—before all else, this means that there is a God, from Whom the Lord Jesus came.  Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father—this means that God is the Father to Whom the Son of God returns.  At the same time, both of these quotations mean that eternal life exists and that death does not mean our annihilation.  The Lord spoke these words just before His death.

O sweet and wonderful tidings!  That which the hearts of all men and nations throughout all ages dimly envisioned, the Lord witnessed as fact, as truth.

And further, these words confirm the unity of the Father and the Son, as well as the divinity of our Lord and Savior.  My brethren, God visited us, the Most-high God Himself: the Holy, Mighty and Immortal God.  This is the culmination of our comfort and our joy.

O Lord Jesus, Son of God, the True Witness of all that is good and for which our hearts yearn day and night, sanctify us, strengthen us and make us immortal.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 16:22
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on joy after sorrow
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice"* (John 16:22).
</div>
The father steps up to the gallows and his sons are crying around him. Instead of the sons comforting him, he comforts his sons. Something similar to this happened between the Lord and His disciples. Walking toward His bitter death, the Lord sorrows more for His disciples' grief than for the suffering He must endure. He comforts them with consolation and encourages them with the prophecy of a new and imminent vision: But I will see you again. This is a prophecy of the Resurrection. Many times our Lord prophesied His death, but whenever He did so, He also prophesied His Resurrection. Nothing unforeseen ever happened to Him. He did not prophesy about Himself only, but also about the disciples. They would be in great sorrow—like a woman when she gives birth and endures pain. As a woman forgets her pain after she gives birth and rejoices *that a man is born into the world* (John 16:21), so would it be with them. In their consciousness, Christ the Lord was still not completely in the form of the God-man. As long as they had known Him as a sufferer and mortal man, they only knew Him partially; until then the birth-pangs continued in their souls. But when they see Him again—resurrected and alive, working miracles and almighty, Lord over all things in heaven and on earth—the pain and sorrow will cease and joy will appear in their hearts. For Christ will be completely formed in their awareness as the God-man, and then they will know Him in His fullness and in His totality. Only then will He be fully born for them.

So it is with us, brethren: as long as we know Him only from His birth to His death on Golgotha, we only know the Lord Jesus partially. We will know Him completely only when we know Him as the Resurrected One, the Victor over death.

O Lord All-victorious, have mercy on us, and by Thy Resurrection cause us to rejoice, as Thou didst comfort and make joyful Thy disciples.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 16:33

on victory over the world

*"In the world ye shall have tribulation;, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world"* (John 16:33).
</div>
The Conqueror of the World, the One and Only, with these words teaches His followers not to fear the world.

Indeed, the world appears very strong; however, is not the One Who created the world stronger than the world?

The world is very frightening for him who does not know that God rules the world, and that He has the authority to hold it in existence as long as He wills and to return it into nonexistence whenever He wills. But to him who knows this, the world is not frightening.

Compared to Christ the Lord, this world is as a fabric woven of weakness itself; while in Christ the Lord, there is not a single weakness. To him who does not know this, the world is frightening; but he who knows it has no fear of the world.

The world has loaned us a body, and because of this it wants to acquire our soul. How can the world overpower us if we stand as soldiers of the Conqueror of the world?

The Conqueror of the World gives us weapons for the battle. By His example He teaches us how to fight, reveals the hidden enemy, shows us the path of attack and retreat, holds us in His hand, protects us under His wing, preserves us with His Life-giving Body, and gives us to drink of His Life-giving Blood. Moreover, He encourages us by crying out: "Take courage!" Brethren, what then can the world do when its defeat is sealed by the victory of Christ?

O Lord, the Conqueror of the World and our victorious Commander, be close to us always, that we may not become frightened; and direct us, that we may always be close to Thee in heart, mind and soul.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## John 17:16

on the citizens of the other world
</div>
<br/>
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world"* (John 17:16)
</div>

Christ the Lord is not of this world, but rather is only in the vesture of this world. This is the Commander clad in the clothing of a slave in order to save the captive enslaved by sin, matter and Satan. As is the Commander, so are His soldiers. Even they, according to the spirit, are not of this world: they are not captives but free; they are not slaves but masters; they are not corruptible but immortal; they are not fallen but are saved. Such are all those whom Christ recruited and who, having tasted immortal life, willingly rejected the world and united themselves with Him, remaining faithful to Him until the end of their lives on earth. Abba Moses said: "No one can enter the army of Christ if he is not totally as fire, if he does not abhor honors and comfort, if he does not sever all bodily desires, and if he does not keep all of God's commandments." Judas was recruited, but he fell away and loved prison more than the royal court, slavery more than freedom, corruption more than immortality, and destruction more than salvation. But the other apostolic recruits, greater and lesser, remained faithful to Him to the end and achieved victory—that is why they are glorified both on earth among men and in heaven among the angels. All who are glorified by the world perish with the world, but those who are glorified by Christ are saved by Christ. The glory of the world is death, but the glory of Christ is life—life eternal and without death.

O Immortal Lord, even though we are of the world according to the body and sin, recruit us into Thine army—the army which, by Thy Spirit, power, wisdom and love, is not of this world. Do this so that, even when we die in this world, we may live in Thine Immortal Kingdom with the angels, apostles and saints, because of the love and prayers of Thy holy apostles.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## John 19:12,16
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on Pilate's wavering
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"From thenceforth Pilate sought to release Him... then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified"* (John 19:12,16).
</div>
From where does this contradiction in Pilate stem? From where is this dual will in one and the same man? While he stood under the radiant face of Christ, Pilate with all his heart wanted to release the Just Man. But when the darkness of the Jews overcame him, he agreed to the works of darkness. This is the seed fallen among the thorns. While the face of Christ shown on the seed, the seed took root, but as soon as the seed was left without this light, the darkness of the thorns smothered it. When the Lord Jesus authoritatively spoke to Pilate of the Heavenly Kingdom, saying to him, *Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, except it were given thee from above* (John 19:11), Pilate then felt overcome by the fear of God. But when the masses of the Jews cried out to Pilate, saying, *If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend* (John 19:12), then Pilate was overcome with fear of the worldly king. His fear for his body overcame his fear for his soul, as sometimes happens even to this day. Pilate was a disciple of worldly wisdom. Worldly wisdom does not offer strength but instills fear. Worldly wisdom sustains not the soul but the body. Worldly wisdom does not instill fear for the soul but fear for the body and all that is physical. Here, in Pilate, we see an obvious and pathetic example of what type of men worldly wisdom produces and educates—disregarding God and opposing Christ. Pilate's weak character and wavering soul is a picture, not only of pagans, but also of weak Christians. Certain Christians daily, imperceptibly, and more often unconsciously, would for a while like to free Christ from the darkened and evil Jewish instinct within themselves. Then at other times, they are ready, from that instinct, to abandon Him to crucifixion. This always happens when a Christian transgresses some of the commandments of Christ for the sake of fulfilling some of his own physical desires. For a moment, that commandment enlightens the heart of a wavering Christian, and again for a moment, the physical darkness overcomes him so much that he completely succumbs to it.

O Lord, long-suffering, do not turn away the radiance of Thy face from us even for one twinkling of an eye, so that the darkness does not overcome us.  O Lord, help us that we will remain children of the light until the end.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

on the Living God and His living children
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's"* (Romans 14:8).
</div>
Whose are we while we live? We are the Lord's. Whose are we after we die? We are the Lord's. Whose are the righteous? They are the Lord's. Whose are the sinners? They are the Lord's. The Lord embraces all, both the living and the dead, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future. No one is so all-embracing as is the Lord Jesus. Who of the so-called benefactors of mankind—teachers, leaders or enlighteners—ever attempted to perform any good for the dead? This can be decisively answered: No one! Even the thought alone would be ridiculous in the eyes of the world—to do something good for the dead! This is amusing to all those who think that death is mightier than God, and that that which death swallows up is destroyed forever. To be concerned for the dead, to do good for the dead, has ceased to be amusing since the revelation of the Lord Jesus, Who revealed that He is God—the God of the living—and Who showed it by His actions, by descending into hades to redeem and save the souls of the righteous, from the time of Adam to the time of His death on the Cross.

Our Lord is all-embracing and all-glorious, first of all by His discerning thoughts (for He thinks about everyone and sees everyone born of women, both those who are above the graves and those who are in the graves); then by His love (for He embraces all the souls of the righteous, regardless of the time or place in which they are concealed); and finally by His labors (for He labors for everyone), to redeem them, to save them, to lead them into the Kingdom, and to glorify them before the face of His Heavenly Father, the Life-giving Spirit and the myriads of holy angels.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# 1 Corinthians


## 1 Corinthians 3:19
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on two different types of wisdom
</div><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God"* (1 Corinthians 3:19).
</div>
This is one of the great tidings that Christianity proclaims to the world. Wisdom according to God and from God is one thing, while the wisdom according to the world and from the world is another. Wisdom according to God is from the Holy Spirit. The apostles were filled with such wisdom when the Holy Spirit descended upon them. Wisdom according to the world is from the senses and from the material realm, and it is true foolishness before God, if it is not seasoned and inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.

All worldly wisdom which is guided only by the physical senses, without regard for the Holy Spirit, is foolishness before God and before God's angels. Such a wisdom does not perceive either the spirit or the purpose of this world; rather, it knows this world only as ashes from without and ashes from within—as ashes which the wind of chance piles up and strews at one moment this way, and at another moment that way.

All the wisdom of man, directed only by the senses and by physical conceptions and fantasies, is foolishness before God and the angels and saints of God, for it does not know man as man, that is, as a spiritual being related to God; rather, it knows man only as a body from without and as a body from within—as a body according to form and as a body according to essence. It is the same as if a monkey, looking at an iron locomotive, described it and said: "This is iron on the outside and iron on the inside—iron which heats it and iron which operates it, iron which gives it direction and iron which stops it!" Brethren, who is able to be filled with the wisdom of God except he who first empties himself of the foolishness of the world? With God's help, each one of us can do this. However, in response to our desires and to our efforts, God's help infallibly comes to meet us—for God alone is Goodness, Wisdom and Holiness.

O Good Lord, wise and holy, fill us with Thy life-creating wisdom.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## 1 Corinthians 4:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on fools, wiser than the world
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"We are fools for Christ's sake"* (1 Corinthians 4:10).
</div>
Thus speaks the great Apostle Paul. He was at first guided by worldly wisdom, which is against Christ, until he recognized the falsehood and decay of this world's wisdom, and the light and stability of Christ's wisdom. Hence the holy apostle did not become angry with the world because they called him a fool for Christ's sake. In defiance of the world, he did not hesitate to be called by this name.

We find no value in how the world regards or designates us. However, it is important to us—extremely important—how the holy angels in heaven regard and designate us when we meet them after death. This is of crucial importance and all else is nothing.

Either we are fools to the world because of Christ or we are fools to Christ because of the world. Oh, how short-lived is the sound of a word from the world! Even if the world calls us fools, the world will die and its word will die! What then is the value of its word? But if the heavenly, immortal ones call us fools, this will not die, but will stay with us as eternal condemnation.

If one does not believe in the Living God, or in eternal life, or in the Incarnation of the Lord Christ, or in Christ's Resurrection, or in the truth of the Gospel, or in God's eternal mercy and justice—is it any wonder that he considers one who does believe in all of this to be a fool?

Oh, may every one of us who is baptized with the sign of the Cross not only find it easy to endure but receive with satisfaction the name "fool" for Christ's sake! Let us rejoice and be glad if the non-believers call us such, for that means that we are close to Christ and far from the non-believers. Let us rejoice and be glad, and repeat with a powerful echo in the ears of the world: Yes, yes, indeed we are fools for Christ's sake!

O Lord Most-wise, strengthen us by Thy power, that we not fear the unbelieving world when they lash us with whips or when they insult us with words for Thy sake.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.



## 1 Corinthians 7:22
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on how we are all free only if we are slaves of Christ
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant"* (1 Corinthians 7:22).
</div>
The great news that Christianity daily announces to the world is that a thing is evaluated at its full value not according to its external appearance, but by its essence. Evaluate things not according to their color and shape but according to their meaning. Evaluate a man not by his position and property but by his heart—in which his feelings, his reason and his will are united.

According to this (which is always a new teaching for the world), he who is outwardly enslaved is not a slave, and he who possesses outward physical freedom is not free. According to worldly understanding, a slave is one who enjoys the world the least, and a free man is one who enjoys the world the most. According to Christian understanding, a slave is one who enjoys the least from the living Christ, while a free man is one who enjoys the most from the living Christ. Further, according to worldly understanding, a slave is one who carries out his own will less frequently and the will of others more frequently, while a free man is one who carries out his own will more often and the will of others less often. However, according to Christian understanding, a slave is one who carries out his own will more often and the will of God less often, while a free man is one who carries out the will of God more frequently and his own will less frequently. To be a slave of the Lord is the only true and worthy freedom of man—and to be a slave to the world and to one's self, to sin and vice, is the only fatal slavery. A man might think of kings on their thrones: are there any men on earth more free? Yet, many kings were the most base and the most unworthy slaves of the earth. Of shackled Christians in the dungeons, a man might think: are there any slaves on earth more miserable? However, the Christian martyrs in the prisons felt like free men, and they were filled with spiritual joy! They chanted Psalms and raised up prayers of gratitude to God. Freedom that is tied to grief and sorrow is not freedom, but slavery. Only freedom in Christ is tied to unspeakable joy. Lasting joy is the mark of true freedom.

O Lord Jesus, the only Good Lord, Who grantest us freedom when Thou bindest us more strongly to Thyself, make us Thy slaves as soon as possible, that we would cease to be slaves of cruel and unmerciful masters.

<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the need of caution for those who think that they are secure
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall"* (1 Corinthians 10:12).
</div>
The Apostle who gives such advice knew human nature and all its weakness perfectly. Day after day, this experience is confirmed: as soon as a man straightens up from the mud of sin, he sways and falls again. As soon as he is cured of the sin of avarice, he falls into the vice of vainglory. Or, as soon as he extends his hand to help a poor man, pride topples him to the other side. Or, as soon as he becomes accustomed to prayer, he opens wide his mouth to degrade those who are not yet accustomed to prayer. Or, as soon as he feels that the Spirit of God is directing him to the path of salvation, he immediately sets himself up as a teacher to the entire world until, unfortunately, through this he completely drives the Spirit from himself.

When the Lord foretold to His disciples that they would all deny Him and flee, then Peter, confident in his stability, cried out: Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended (Matthew 26:33). Discerning his very heart and seeing him already fallen into self-conceit and pride, the Lord responded to him: This night, before the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me thrice (Matthew 26:34). And when such a fall happened to the apostle in the immediate proximity of the Lord, why would it not happen to us? This is why, brethren, when we rise and turn from a certain sin and stand erect, we should ascribe this to the power and mercy of God and not to ourselves, and we should be very vigilant to protect ourselves and implore God that we do not fall again, be it to one side or the other side, but walk on the upright path of the Lord.

O All-seeing Lord, help us to stand straight before Thee by the Spirit, and when we become upright, uphold us that we do not fall anymore.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## 1 Corinthians 10:24
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on concern for the salvation of our neighbors
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth"* (1 Corinthians 10:24).
</div>
This is the principle of the saints of God, both now and in the past, always and forever. This is the principle on which society is built. Upon this principle can be established the most perfect, most God-pleasing and most prosperous human society. This is the saving principle for every type of difficulty, against which contemporary men struggle without victory and without hope. The holy soul is concerned with where the homeless will spend the night, how the hungry will be fed, how the naked will be clothed. The holy soul is concerned, and prays to God that his neighbors be saved; that their hearts be filled with love toward God; that their minds be directed toward God; that the wicked turn from the path of wickedness; that those wavering in the Faith be strengthened; that those who are strengthened be sustained; that those who have died see the face of God; that the living be written in the Book of Life in the Kingdom of Light.

But beware, brethren, and see how the destructive and antisocial principle of the devil can be phrased in like manner, word for word. This principle of the devil says: No one should look to his own body to preserve it in purity from sin, but rather everyone should look to the bodies of others in order to ruin and to destroy them. No one should look to his own soul to see how to save it; rather everyone should look to the soul of someone else in order to blacken it, to curse it, to impoverish it and to destroy it. Let no one look at his house in order to build it and renew it; rather, let everyone look at the home of another in order to burn it and demolish it. No one should look at his granaries in order to fill them; rather, one should look at the granaries of others in order to steal from them and empty them.

Behold, brethren, how this principle can be a principle either of good or of evil; it is a sharp two-edged sword, an angel or Satan. See how this principle in the satanic spirit and form has gained momentum on all sides today!

O Lord, Holy Spirit, Who, through the tongue of the apostle of God, has released these holy words in the world, as bright rays of the sun to illuminate and not to burn us, help us now to fulfill them in the proper heavenly sense—to the glory of the Triune God and for the salvation of our souls.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## 1 Corinthians 15:26
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on victory over the last enemy
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"* (1 Corinthians 15:26).
</div>
Man's first enemy is the devil, the second is sin and the third is death. The Lord Jesus conquered all three of these enemies of the human race. By His humiliation He conquered the proud devil; by His death He conquered sin; and by His Resurrection He conquered death. In conquering all of our enemies, He invites us to be partakers in His glorious victory. It is not that we ourselves conquer, but that we are joined to the Victor. Only His power conquers, only His weapons vanquish. We are without power and weapons, but our enemies are frightful. With Him and alongside Him, we conquer those mightier than ourselves. What is the price He offers to us for His victory? A meager price, my brethren; for a very paltry price He offers us the most precious victory. To humble ourselves and to submit ourselves to the will of God—that is the price He seeks to conquer the devil for us. To die unto ourselves, to die to fleshly desires and passions—that is the price He seeks to conquer sin for us. To live for Him and not for ourselves, to receive Him into our hearts—that is the price He seeks to conquer death for us. He conquered all the enemies openly and completely, but this is the price for which He offers His victory to each of us. The Apostle Paul says: *Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ* (1 Corinthians 15:57).

O resurrected Lord, enlighten, strengthen and heal us by Thy victory.

We who are grateful raise up to Thee glory and praise forever. Amen.

## 1 Corinthians 15:35
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the resurrection of the dead
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?'"* (1 Corinthians 15:35).
</div>
The Apostle Paul knows in advance the objections that the unbelievers will make concerning the resurrection from the dead, and he rejects them in advance. Even today, the non-believers—who have not seen with physical eyes the miracle of the resurrection in nature, much less the spiritual resurrection—ask: "How will the dead be raised?" *Thou fool!* continues the apostle, *that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die* (1 Corinthians 15:36). Unless the seed dies in the ground, the plant will not grow; in other words, something totally different from the seed will sprout up. The unbelievers see through their eyes yet do not see, but ask: "How will a dead man resurrect?" How? In the same way that Christ resurrected. He went down lifeless into the tomb, and rose alive. Even nature manifests resurrection from the dead; but more strongly than nature, it is manifested by the resurrected Lord. In order to make it easier for us to believe and to hope—to believe in the resurrection in general and to have hope in our own resurrection—He Himself resurrected from the grave and, prior to that, resurrected Lazarus the four-days-dead, the son of the widow of Nain, and the daughter of Jarius.

The unbelievers ask: "With what kind of body will the dead rise?" In whatever kind of body God wills. With God there are many kinds of bodies. The Apostle Paul divides all bodies into two groups: earthly bodies and heavenly bodies. Therefore, they who have died in earthly bodies will be clothed with heavenly bodies: the incorruptible will replace the corruptible; the immortal will replace the mortal; the beautiful will replace the ugly. In the heavenly body, man will also recognize himself and others around him, just as man recognizes himself both when he is clothed in beggar's rags and when he is clothed in royal purple.

Lord, Most-rich, do not give us over to eternal corruption but clothe us as royal sons in the garment of immortality.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

on the vision of the invisible world
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen"* (2 Corinthians 4:18).
</div>
We see this material and transient world, but we look to that spiritual and immortal world.
We see earthly joy, often interrupted by tears and sighs and, in the end, always concluding with death; but we look to spiritual joy among the angels and saints of God in the heavens, to joy uninterrupted and eternal.

We see the sufferings and failures of the righteous in this life; but we look at their glory and celebration in the next world.

We see many successes, the glory and the honor of the unrighteous in this life; but we look to their defeat, condemnation and indescribable torment in eternity.

We see the Church of God often humiliated and persecuted in this world; but we look to the final victory of the Church over all of her enemies and adversaries, both visible and invisible.

Brethren, we often see tyrants and abductors as rulers and wealthy men in this age, and we see saints as poor, dejected and forgotten; but then we look at the other kingdom, the Kingdom of God—eternal, sinless and immortal—in which the saints will reign, without one tyrant or abductor.

O Lord, most patient and most merciful, open our spiritual vision, that we may see that which awaits us after this brief life, and that we endeavor to fulfill Thy law.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For I seek not yours, but you"* (2 Corinthians 12:14).
</div>
These words, which could have only been spoken by the fiery apostolic love toward one's neighbor, express the essence of the relationship of the Christian toward God, and of God toward the Christian. The love of God could very well say: "Thou, O Christian, fastest for My sake; for My sake thou dost distribute alms; for My sake thou dost lift up heartfelt prayers; for My sake thou buildest churches; for My sake thou offerest sacrifices and performest many other good deeds. All of this is good, and all of this is pleasing to Me, but thou art more precious to Me than all of this. In the end, I seek nothing of all of this; rather, I seek thee, only thee."

The love of a Christian could very well say: "O Lord, Thou gavest me health and that is good. Thou kindlest the light; Thou permittest the rain to fall; Thou dost refresh the air by Thy thunder, and that is good. Thou bestowest wealth, wisdom, many years, offspring and many other good things which Thou dost bountifully set on the table of this life. All of this is good and most good. I receive all of this with gratitude. But, in the ultimate end, that is only the hem of Thy garment. Ultimately, I do not seek anything of that, but Thee, O Lord—Thee alone do I seek."

O my brethren, that which is seen with the physical eyes is not God, and that which is seen with the physical eyes is not man. That which is seen in the whole of nature is only something of God; and that which is seen in the physical garment is only something of man. Brethren, God is Love that lowers heaven to earth. Brethren, man is love that raises earth to heaven.

O Lord, Lover of mankind, Creator and Almighty, take up Thine abode more and even more within us, with Thy Life-giving Spirit, that we may live; that we may be alive in Thy kingdom without death.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Galatians

## Galatians 4:1
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the heir and the slave
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Now I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant"* (Galatians 4:1).
</div>
As long as the heir apparent is in the cradle, what would make him better than the son of a slave? His body is not better, nor are his thoughts more elevated, nor are his wishes or desires more pure. Such is the son of the king, the son of a slave and the son of a beggar. For a few years the son of the king does not differ from the son of the slave. However, at some point the king's son reaches maturity and, fully conscious of his dignity, receives authority over the kingdom. Likewise the slave's son reaches maturity and, with full consciousness, succumbs to the yoke of slavery. Then the enormous difference is seen. Then it is clearly manifest that the heir and the slave are not equal. The slave must serve, and the king must rule.

The apostle means to say that it is the same with Christians and with those who are not Christians. The non-Christian is a slave to nature, but the Christian rules over nature. The pre-Christian era of the history of mankind shows us how man was a slave to the elements of nature, to the flesh, to idols, and to creatures. The Christian era of the history of mankind shows us how man was master and owner, a nobleman of a royal race, and heir to all.

Even those who knew about the One True God, as did the Israelites, did not stand before God like children or as heirs before their Father, but were as slaves and servants before their Lord and Judge. *But when the fullness of time was come* (Galatians 4:4), the Only-Begotten Son of God came to earth. He made it possible *that we might receive the adoption of sons* (Galatians 4:5), and by the Spirit of God to address God: *Abba, Father!* (Galatians 4:6).

Brethren, why did Christ come to earth? He did so to make us better than slaves and to give us the right of sonship and the duty of the master. The right of sonship is such that in the name Christ we can call God "Father."  The duty of the master is to rule over ourselves, our flesh, our thoughts, our desires, and all of nature around us.

O Only-begotten Son of God, by Thy mercy and sacrifice we have received the adoption of sons. Oh, help us that with Thine aid we may persevere to the end in purity and in truth.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Philippians

## Philippians 1:24
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on love for your neighbor
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you"* (Philippians 1:24).
</div>
Illumined with the love of Christ, the Apostle Paul acknowledged, in his Epistle to the Philippians, that for him death is a gain because his life is Christ's. Paul's love for Christ draws him toward death so that he may stand by Christ as soon as possible, but his love for the faithful compels him to remain in the flesh. However, these are not two loves that attract the Apostle and pull him in two directions, but one and the same love that opens before him two treasures of wealth. One treasure is the blessed world in heaven, and the other treasure is the souls of the faithful on earth. That heavenly treasure is increased by that earthly treasure; both treasures flow together into one. To go to heaven—to that the Apostle is drawn by love and reward; to remain on earth—to that he is drawn by love and duty.

When mortal man, my brethren, discovers that it is more important to remain in the flesh out of love for his brothers, how is it strange that the Eternal God knew, before the Apostle, that it was more important to be in the flesh for the salvation of mankind than out of the flesh in the spiritual kingdom? Does not this confession of Paul before the Philippians explain to us with complete clarity the reasons for the Incarnation of the Son of God? There, in heaven, is the true Kingdom of Christ and the true life of Christ, without the mingling of sin and death. But the Son of God's love toward men deemed it necessary to remain in the flesh on earth among men. Truly, we need to be thankful to the Apostle Paul that he, in explaining himself to us, explained the mystery of Christ's coming and His dwelling in the flesh.

O Lord, wonderful art Thou in Thy saints.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Philippians 2:7
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the vision of the eyes and the vision of the soul
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And being found in fashion as a man"* (Philippians 2:7).
</div>
This the Apostle Paul said. He is that same apostle who said about the Lord Jesus that *He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation* (Colossians 1:15), and *in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily* (Colossians 2:9). This is the Lord according to His Essence and according to His internal Nature, but He was made in the likeness of men. Men, whose hearts are hardened like stone and whose minds are darkened, recognize objects around themselves only through their eyes. Such men, in those days, looked with their eyes and saw Jesus as a man. It was not given to them to know anything more about Him than that which their physical eyes saw. Physical man saw Jesus and beheld only the body, but saw neither God nor a perfect and sinless man in that body.

Even today, whosoever judges only by that which he sees, denies to Jesus all that he cannot see in other men. No one who judges the Lord with only his eyes can speak the truth about Him. That which the eyes can see of Him is but a small veil, behind which is hidden the eternal mysteries of heaven and the greatest mysteries of time and earth. In order to see that which is hidden in Him, behind the physical veil, one must have spiritual vision.  That is the Spirit of God in one's heart, the Spirit Who draws back the veil and reveals the mysteries.

O Lord, Mystery most sweet, make us worthy to be visited by Thy Holy Spirit.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Hebrews

## Hebrews 5:13-14
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the gradual nature of spiritual development
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil"* (Hebrews 5:13-14).
</div>
Those who feed on the food of the milk of sensual reflection cannot easily distinguish between good and evil. They usually come to the conclusion that all faiths are equally the same in value; that sin is the indispensable shadow of virtue; and that evil, in general, is the unavoidable companion of good. A true Christian cannot come to such erroneous conclusions. A true Christian is a mature person who is not fed on milk, but who is distrustful of the senses, and who judges much more finely and makes a finer distinction between the value of all that is and all that has been. The Christian, indeed, is given clear directions for distinguishing good from evil by God's Revelation; nevertheless, long and laborious study is necessary in order that the Christian, striving for perfection, might in every given case know what is good and what is evil. This knowledge should pass over into feeling in order to be trustworthy and without error. Both good and evil wish to touch the heart of man. That is why man should be trained, by the feeling of the heart, to immediately recognize what approaches him—in the same manner as, with his tongue, he immediately senses the salty and the unsalty, the sweet and the bitter.

Brethren, let us endeavor every day and every moment to purify our hearts, so that our hearts might always be able to distinguish good and evil. For in everything that happens to us, the question is posed: "What is good and what is evil?" This is precisely why it does happen to us: so that we can realize what is good and follow after good. We face temptations a hundred times a day. He who has eyes to see, let him see.

O Lord, Lover of mankind, warm our hearts with good which is from Thee. Make us wise, O Lord, to be able to distinguish good from evil. O Master, strengthen us, that we might always embrace good and discard evil for the sake of Thy glory, O Lover of mankind, and for the sake of our salvation.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Hebrews 11:24-26
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on Christ's humiliation as wealth
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"By faith Moses ... esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, ... had respect unto the recompense of the reward"* (Hebrews 11:24-26).
</div>
Moses did not want to remain in the palace of Pharaoh nor to be called his adopted son. Desiring more, he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the *pleasures of sin for a season* (Hebrews 11:25). How different was Moses from his descendants, who for reasons similar to Pharaoh's condemned the King of Glory to death! All of them would have rather lived one more year in the decaying court of Pharaoh than to travel with God for forty years in the wilderness. Moses left all honors, riches and vanities, which only the wealth of Egypt could provide. At the command of God, Moses started out through the foodless and waterless wilderness with faith that beyond it lay the Promised Land. All of this also means to hold Christ's humiliation above all the wealth of Egypt.

Christ's humiliation is what worldly men, who exude a powerful stench of the earth, are ashamed of in Christ. That is Christ's poverty on earth: His fasting, His vigil, His prayer, His wandering without a roof over His head, His condemnation, His humiliation, and His shameful death. Christ's humiliation was valued by the apostles, and after them by countless saints, who thought this to be greater wealth than all the riches in the entire world. Following these indignities, the Lord resurrected, opened the gates of heaven and revealed the Promised Land of Paradise, into which He led mankind along the path of His humiliation and through the wilderness of His suffering.

O Lord, glorified and resurrected, help us that we may hold unwaveringly every drop of Thy sweat and Thy blood as a treasure greater than all worldly riches.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

*"Who will have all men to be saved"* (1 Timothy 2:4).
</div>
God desires that all men be saved; that is why He descended into hades to save those who had lived on earth before His coming. For, had He not descended into hades, an enormous number of righteous souls would have perished forever. Moreover, had He not descended into hades, the main habitat of malice against God and the human race, hades would have remained undestroyed. There were two reasons that motivated Christ, the Giver of Life, to descend into hades in the Spirit: first, to destroy the nest of the powers of hades and, second, to bring from hades to heaven the souls of the ancestors, prophets and righteous men and women who had fulfilled the Old Law of God (dispensation) and had thus pleased God. Before Satan had done exulting at the sight of Christ humiliated and lifeless on the Cross, Christ appeared and lifeless on the Cross, Christ appeared alive and almighty in the midst of hades, the primary abode of Satan. What unexpected and dreadful news for Satan! For three years Satan had woven snares against Christ on earth, and in three days, behold, Christ destroyed Satan's kingdom and carried away the most precious booty, in the form of a throng of righteous souls.

O Lord, Thou desirest that all men be saved. We pray to Thee: save even us. For there is no salvation or Savior outside of Thee. In Thee do we hope, Thee alone do we worship—Thee, the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always. Amen.

on contentment with that which is most necessary to us
</div><br /><div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content"* (1 Timothy 6:8).
</div>

The apostles of God taught others that which they themselves fulfilled in their own lives. When they had food and clothing, they were content. Even when it happened that they had neither food nor clothing, they were content, for their contentment did not emanate from the outside but from within. Their contentment was not so cheap as the contentment of an animal, but costly—more costly and more rare. Internal contentment, the contentment of peace and love of God in the heart—that is the contentment of greater men, and that was the apostolic contentment. In great battles, generals are dressed and fed as ordinary soldiers: they do not seek contentment in food or in clothes but in victory. Victory is the primary contentment of those who battle. Brethren, Christians are constantly in battle—in battle for the victory of the spirit over the material, in battle for the victory of the higher over the lower, and in battle for the victory of man over his beastly nature. Is it not, therefore, absurd to engage in battle and concern oneself not with victory but with external decorations and ornaments? Is it not foolish to give to one's enemies the marks of identification? Our invisible enemy, Satan, rejoices at our vanity and supports us in every vain thought. The invisible enemy occupies us with every possible unreasonable pettiness and idleness, only to impose upon our minds the heavy forgetfulness of that for which we are here on earth. The invisible enemy presents to us the worthless as important, the irrelevant as essential, and the detrimental as beneficial, only in order to achieve victory over us and to destroy us forever.

O Lord, Holy, Mighty and Immortal, Who created us from the mud and breathed the living soul into mud; do not, O Lord, allow the mud to overcome us! Help our spirit, that it always be stronger than the earth.

To Thee be glory and praise forever.  Amen.

*"And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"* (1 John 5:4).
</div>
Christ the Lord conquered the world. That, brethren, is also our victory. The apostles conquered the world and that is our victory. The saints, virgins and martyrs conquered the world and that is our victory. Brethren, there is nothing more powerful in the world than the Christian Faith. The swords that struck this Faith became blunt and broken, but the Faith remained. The kings who fought against this Faith were smothered under the anathema of their evildoings. The kingdoms that waged war against this Faith have been destroyed.The towns that rejected this Faith lay demolished in their ruins. The heretics who corrupted this Faith perished in soul and body, and under anathema they departed from this world, but this Faith remained.

Brethren, when the world pursues us with its temptations—the temptation of external beauty, the temptation of riches, the temptation of pleasure, the temptation of transient glory—with what shall we resist and by what shall we be victorious, if not by this Faith? In truth, we prevail by nothing except by this invincible Faith, which knows of something greater than all the wealth of this world.

When all the temptations of this world reveal the opposite side of their faces—when beauty turns into ugliness, health into sickness, riches into poverty, glory into dishonor, authority into humiliation, and all-blossoming physical life into filth and stench—by what shall we overcome this grief, this decay, this fifth and stench, and preserve ourselves from despair, if not by this Faith? In truth, by nothing except this invincible Faith, which teaches us eternal and unchangeable values in the Kingdom of Christ.

When death shows its destructive power over our neighbors, over our relatives and our families, over our flowers, over our crops, over the works of our hands, and when it turns its irresistible teeth even on us—by what shall we conquer the fear of death, and by what shall we unlock the doors of life, stronger than death, if not by this Faith? In truth, by nothing except this invincible Faith, which knows about the resurrection and life without death.

O Lord Jesus, Conqueror of the world, help us also to conquer the world by our faith in Thee.

## 1 John 5:7-8

*"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit and the water and the blood: and these three are together"* (1 John 5: 7-8).
</div>

When we read Holy Scripture, we should be alert to keep an eye on every word. To the rapid reader, for example, this distinction which the Evangelist draws between the Heavenly Trinity and the earthly trinity will not become apparent. Concerning the Heavenly Trinity, he says, and these three are one; and concerning the earthly trinity, he says, and these three are together. There is an enormous difference between "being one" and "being together." The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are One, whereas the spirit, the water and the blood are only together and are not one. Even enemies could be together, but are not one. All the people on earth are together, but they are not one. Water and blood constitute the body, and the spirit is the spirit. *For the flesh has desires against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh* (Galatians 5:17). They are not one, but they are still together. When man dies, the union is broken and ceases to exist. Blood and water go to one side, and the spirit goes to another side. However, the Persons of the Divine Trinity in the heavens are not only together, but They are also One.

There is also another trinity in the inner heaven of man which should be not only a unity but a oneness, so that man may be blessed in this world and in the other world. That is the union of the mind, heart and will. As long as these three are only in togetherness, man will be at war with himself and with the Heavenly Trinity. However, when these three become one, so that none rules and none is enslaved, then man becomes filled with the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding (Philippians 4:7), that surpasses man's every word, every explanation, every fear and every sorrow. Then the small heaven in man begins to resemble that great heaven of God, and the "image and likeness of God" become apparent in man.

O Triune God, help us to at least resemble those who resemble Thee.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

Further, he who hopes in luck and well-being in this brief earthly existence, and who does not extend his hope beyond the grave has a dead hope. He who hopes in the resurrection and eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven has a living hope.

Truly, a living hope is better than a dead hope; as life is better than death; as light is better than darkness; as health is better than sickness; as understanding is better than ignorance.

But Who brought and showed man that living hope—Who and how? The Apostle Peter gives an answer to that question: Our Lord Jesus Christ, by His Resurrection from the dead. No one else but the Lord Jesus Christ and by nothing else than His Resurrection from the dead. By His Resurrection, the Lord gave wings to the pathetic hopes of man and extended those hopes beyond the grave, showing man the goal and purpose and fruit beyond the grave.

All of this is confirmed not by a credulous man, but by an apostle who wavered for a long while in his faith and who denied Christ three times. That is why St. Peter's testimony of the resurrected Lord and the significance of His Resurrection is inexpressibly priceless for us.

O resurrected Lord, Thou Victor over death, uproot from us dead hope, and plant a living hope in us through the prayers of St. Peter, Thy great apostle.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

# Revelation

## Revelation 1:14
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the majesty of Christ the Victor
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire"* (Revelation 1:14).
</div>
That is how John the God-seer saw Jesus after His Resurrection and victory. He saw Him as the Son of Man, clothed in a lengthy garment, girded about with a golden sash, with seven stars in His right hand, and His face shining like the sun at its brightest (cf. Revelation 1:16). It was with this kind of power and glory that He appeared—He Who on the Cross was not radiant and Who seemed to be the weakest among the sons of men to every passersby.

Why was His hair as white as wool and snow? Was not our Lord not yet thirty-four years old when they killed Him? From where, then, comes His white hair? Does not white hair indicate old age? It is true that white hair does indicate old age with mortal man, but with Christ in Glory it indicated more than old age—it indicated eternity. Eternal youthful age! Old age is the past, and youth is the future. At the same time, is He not both? More than all the times past and all times to come, and even beyond time, Christ is eternity beyond time. Why were His eyes like a flame of fire? Because He is the All-seeing. All sorts of things can be hidden from the sun, but of all that is in the heavens, on the earth, or under the earth, nothing can be hidden from His sight. He perceives all the threads of the fabric of nature; He perceives all the atoms in the stones, every drop of water in the sea, every particle of air, and all the thoughts and desires of every created soul. This is the One and the same and no other; He who out of compassion for the human race came to earth, clothed Himself in a mortal and suffering body, was ridiculed, was mocked and was spat upon by sinful men. That is the same One and no other, Who without radiance hung on the Cross between thieves, and as a dead man was buried by Joseph and Nicodemus.

O brethren, how awesome it is to ponder upon what a great and majestic Visitor the earth had! It is even more terrible (awesome) to ponder Him against Whom deranged men lifted up their hands!

O Majestic Lord, forgive us our sins and remember us all in Thy power and glory.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Revelation 1:17
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the weakness of man before the majesty of God
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead"* (Revelation 1:17).
</div>
It was St. John who fell as though dead when he saw the Lord Jesus in glory. St. John—the Beloved Disciple of Jesus, the Evangelist, the chaste one, the one who loved the Lord, the zealot for holiness—could neither stand on his feet nor compose himself when he saw his Teacher in His heavenly glory and power! Instead he fell, as though dead. Therefore, how will they who sin against Him, rise up against Him, ridicule His name, despise His love and sacrifice, mock His cross, trample upon His commandments, persecute His Church, shame His priests, and kill His faithful, endure the presence of the Lord and His eyes like a fiery flame? What will happen to them before the face of the Lord if St. John fell as dead when he caught sight of Him? What will happen to educated men who corrupt others? What will happen to teachers who destroy the Faith in young souls? What will happen to skeptics who through their doubt poison the minds of men? What will happen to thieves and robbers, to the immoral, and to the child-killers? What will happen to the enemies of Christ if the friend of Jesus falls, as though dead, before His indescribable, effulgent (glistening) glory?

Such is the glory, power, authority, beauty, lordship, light and majesty of the Lord Jesus, resurrected and ascended, that His closest companions, who for three years on earth gazed upon His face without fear, now fall as though dead when they see His face in the heavens following His passion, death and victory!

O Lord All-glorious and Almighty, illuminate us and enliven us by Thy power and glory.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Revelation 1:17-18
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the First and Last Who lives
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Fear not; I am the First and the Last: I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore"* (Revelation 1:17-18).
</div>
Thus says the Lord Jesus to His beloved disciple John in a vision on the island of Patmos. Do not be afraid of what? Do not be afraid of the pagan persecution of the Church. Do not be afraid of the tormentors who persecute My Faithful on all sides. Do not be afraid of emperors who raise up persecutions against the Christians. Do not be afraid of this world's powerful tyrants, who mock and ridicule My humility in My death. Do not be afraid of demons, who blind men with passions so that they cannot see the truth which I brought to the world. Do not be afraid of anything!

How can I not be afraid, O Lord!, Why then should we not be afraid when the entire world is armed to the teeth and assembled against us, who are small in number and unarmed?

Do not be afraid, for I am the First and the Last, the Alpha and the Omega. All of those forces armed against you are nothing but a whirlwind of the dead. I am before time and I am after time; before the beginning of all and after the end of all things that were created, I Am! They are all locked in one span of time, which I measured out to every created thing; and outside of this span of time, they cannot extend.

Do not be afraid, for "I was dead; and behold, I am alive." Do not be afraid, not even of death. I am before death and after death. Death is My servant, and I permit My servant to serve Me in the world. I gave Myself up to My servant for three days and ordered him to release Me, and now I am alive. I am the Master of death as well as of life. I am the Master of time as well as of eternity. Do not be afraid!  I am alive forever and ever. And you will be alive with Me. All they who remain faithful to Me and are not afraid will live with Me. Do not be afraid; *I am Alpha and Omega* (Revelation 1:11).

O Lord, eternal and immortal, allow these holy words of Thine to ring always in the souls of Thy faithful whenever a persecution is raised up against Thy Holy Church, so that, holding on to Thy right hand, we may not be afraid.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Revelation 2:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on faithfulness in suffering and the crown of life
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer... Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life"* (Revelation 2:10).
</div>
By His suffering our Lord eased our suffering. He endured the greatest of pain and emerged as the Victor. That is why He can encourage us in our lesser sufferings. He suffered and endured in righteousness while we suffer and endure in expiating our own sins. This is why He can doubly remind us to endure to the end as He, the Sinless One, endured. Not one of us helped or alleviated His pains and endurance, yet He stands beside each one of us when we suffer and He alleviates our pains and misfortunes. That is why He has the right to tell each one who suffers for His name's sake: "Do not be afraid! Do not be afraid of anything that you are going to suffer, for I alone have endured all sufferings and am familiar with them. I was not frightened by a single suffering. I received them upon Myself, and in the end I overcame them all. I did not overcome them by dismissing them or fleeing from them but by receiving them all upon Myself voluntarily and enduring them all to the end. And so you also should accept voluntary suffering, for I see and know how much and how long you can endure.

“If your suffering should continue until death itself and if it should be the cause of your death, nevertheless, do not be afraid: I will give thee the crown of life. I will crown you with immortal life, in which I reign eternally with the Father and the Life-giving Spirit."

God did not send you to earth to live comfortably, but rather to prepare you for eternal life. It would be a great tragedy if your Creator were unable to give you a better, longer, and brighter life than that which is on earth, which reeks of decay and death and is shorter than the life of a raven.

O my brethren, let us listen to the words of the Lord and all of our sufferings will be alleviated. If the blows of the world seem as hard as stones, they will become as the foam of the sea when we obey the Lord.

O Victorious Lord, teach us more about Thy long-suffering. And when we become exhausted, extend Thy hand and sustain us.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Revelation 5:10
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on Christians as kings and priests
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"And hast made us unto our God kings and priests"* (Revelation 5:10).
</div>
The Lord Jesus wants to make all men like unto Himself. As the Son of God, He wants all men to become the adopted sons of God. As a King, He wants them to rule with Him. As a Priest, He desires that all should be fellow priests with Him; as Almighty, that all should share in His strength; as Eternal, that all should share in His immortality; as Holy, that all should share in His holiness; and as the Resurrected One, that all should be the children of the Resurrection. This the Lord desired, and that is why He descended to earth: to separate us from the animals, to elevate us above the life of the animals, and to give us dignity over His visible creation, a dignity which Adam had in Paradise before the Fall.

Because of this, His love for mankind and His plan for salvation for all people, the Lord was crucified on the Cross by the Jewish elders. And He reaps the thorns of ingratitude and misunderstanding countless times, even from us Christians today. We show ourselves to be ungrateful and unreasonable whenever we undermine and trample His commandments. By his sins, every sinner plaits a new wreath of thorns and places it on His sacred head. When did He ever offend us, that we should do this to Him? When did He ever think evil about any one of us, that we should return Him evil? He lowered Himself into our foetid pit, where we have become accustomed to live with snakes and scorpions, and pulled us up to the heights, to light and purity in the Kingdom. He wants to make us kings and priests, but we drive away His saving hand and return to the pit with snakes and scorpions.

O brethren, this humiliation of Him and destruction of ourselves is enough and more than enough! Let us firmly grasp the hand of our Savior and follow Him. He desires good for us. He does good for us. For our good, He suffered. He is our One and Only Friend, Who does not change.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.


## Revelation 17:14
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the battle of the Lamb with the beasts
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings"* (Revelation 17:14).
</div>
Who speaks these marvelous words? John, who saw God. Who is this Lamb? Christ the Lord. Who is this Lord of lords and King of kings? Christ the Lord. With whom will He wage war and whom will He defeat? He will defeat the beast which has seven heads and all those who received authority, honor and riches from the unclean beast.

The Lamb among the beasts! St. John also saw the Lamb as the Victor over all the beasts. Christ among the demons! One would say: "They will devour Him!" Nevertheless, the terrified demons cry out to Him for mercy and flee from Him without turning back. Christ among His tormentors! One would say: "They will destroy Him forever." Nevertheless, He resurrects and conquers, and they flee from Him in terror and perish. The Church among the heathens! One would say: "They will flood her like a wave covering a small island." Nevertheless, the pagan kingdoms sank and fell apart, while the Church still exists, flourishes and advances. The Christian Faith among dry philosophers and theoreticians! One would say: "They will outwit it and drive it from the world." Nevertheless, they steer one another into lies and persecutions, but the Christian Faith saves men. Piety in the midst of blasphemers and apostates! One would say: "They will soil it!" Nevertheless, they are smothered in their own filth, and reverence preserves itself in unsoiled purity. Christian meekness and tears surrounded by tyrants and abductors! One would say: "It will die of hunger!" Nevertheless, they live and are satiated, while the tyrants and abductors suffer from starvation. The Lamb among the beasts! Nevertheless, the Lamb is the Victor.

O Lord, meek and good, Lamb of God all-gentle, imbue us with Thy meekness and goodness, so that even we may share in Thy victory.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.

## Revelation 22:7
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
on the imminence of the coming of the Lord
</div><br />
<div style={{textAlign:'right'}}>
*"Behold, I come quickly"* (Revelation 22:7).
</div>
Unbelievers and those who are perishing in spirit will say: "Nearly two thousand years ago He promised that He would come, and He has not come yet!" This is how they laugh—those who will lament in eternal torment. But we who are prepared for happiness in His Kingdom know that He will come in power and glory just as He promised.

We know that He has already come countless times and showed Himself to His faithful ones. Did He not come to John the Divine, to whom He spoke these words: *Behold, I come quickly* (Revelation 3:11)? John saw Him in power and glory, and felt His hand on him when he was frightened, and fell before His feet as dead: *And He laid his right hand upon me* (Revelation 1:17). Did He not come to Saul, when he breathed hatred against the Christians and when on the road to Damascus he fell on the ground, seeing the Lord and hearing His voice saying: *Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me* (Acts 9:4)? And again, did He not enter into the heart of the Apostle Paul when he recognized that *nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me* (Galatians 2:20)? Did He not come to the countless martyrs, both male and female, who suffered for His name, to encourage them, to heal them, and to have mercy on them? Did He not come to Anthony the Great, Theodore Stratelates, St. Charalampus, St. Marina, St. Sylvester and many, many more?

But what are we saying? Did He not return from the kingdom of death on the third day and appear before the apostles? Did He not come to the aid of the Church many, many times? And did He not resurrect her as from the dead whenever her enemies rejoiced, thinking that they had given His Church over to death forever? Did He not manifest His power in the Church in the time of Nero as well as in the time of Constantine; in the time of Julian, as well as in the time of Justinian; in the time of Arab tyranny, as well as in the time of the Turkish and Mongolian oppression of Christians?

O my faithful brethren, do not submit to deception. He came countless times and comes even today. He comes to every soul that is accessible, regardless of impurity. However, we are all waiting for Him to come for the last time in power and glory. We know that His coming is certain. O Lord Most-gracious, before Thou comest, make us worthy to recognize Thy face and to be ashamed of our own faces, darkened by sin.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
