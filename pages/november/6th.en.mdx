## SAINT PAUL THE CONFESSOR, PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE

When Blessed Patriarch Alexander lay on his deathbed, the sorrowing faithful asked him who he would have follow him as the chief shepherd of the spiritual flock of Christ. He said: "If you desire a shepherd who will teach you and who will shine with virtues, choose Paul; but if you only want a suitable man, externally adorned, choose Macedonius." The people chose Paul. Unfortunately, this was not accepted by the Arian heretics, nor was it accepted by Emperor Constantius, who was then in Antioch. Paul was soon deposed, and fled to Rome with St. Athanasius the Great. In Rome, Pope Julian and Emperor Constans received them warmly and upheld them in their Orthodox Faith. Emperor Constans and Pope Julian saw to it that Paul was returned to his throne, but when Emperor Constans died the Arians raised their heads again, and Patriarch Paul was banished to Cucusus in Armenia. Once, as Paul was celebrating the Divine Liturgy in exile, he was attacked by the Arians and strangled with his omophorion, in the year 351 A.D. In 381 A.D., during the reign of Emperor Theodosius, Paul's relics were transferred to Constantinople, and in the year 1236 A.D. they were translated to Venice, where they still repose. His beloved priests and notaries, Marcian and Martyrius (October 25), suffered soon after their patriarch.

## THE VENERABLE BARLAAM OF KHUTYN, THE MIRACLE-WORKER

Barlaam was born and raised as a Christian in Novgorod the Great. After the death of his parents, he was tonsured a monk and devoted himself to a life of strict asceticism. He founded a monastery on the bank of the Volkhov River, at a place where a heavenly light appeared to him. Barlaam was a great miracle-worker both during his life and after his death: he saw into the secrets of men's hearts, expelled unclean spirits and healed all sicknesses. After his repose, a servant of Prince Vasili Vasilievich became gravely ill and begged to be taken to the saint's grave. He further instructed them that, if he should die on the way, they should carry his dead body to the saint. And thus it happened—he died on the way and they carried him dead to the monastery, where he returned to life, stood up and prostrated before the grave of the saint. In the year 1471 A.D., Tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered that the saint's grave be dug up. As soon as they began to dig, a flame sprang from the grave and flared up along the walls of the church. The Tsar was so frightened that he ran out of the church and, in his haste, forgot his staff, which is still preserved beside the grave of the saint. The commemoration of this miracle is celebrated on the Friday after the Sunday of All Saints.

## COMMEMORATION OF THE FALLING OF ASH FROM THE SKY

This took place in Constantinople in the year 472 A.D.*) during the reign of Emperor Leo the Great and Patriarch Gennadius. (See "Reflection" below.)

*) According to the Greek Synaxarion, this incident occurred in 475 A.D. and not in 472 A.D.


## HYMN OF PRAISE
<div style={{textAlign:'center', color:'crimson', fontWeight:'bold'}}>
THE LORD'S MERCY AND GOODNESS
</div>
>Our Lord is mercy and true goodness,  
Yet He allows man to suffer for his sin:  
Floods, sickness, earthquakes, droughts,  
Horror and pains for body and soul.  
He who does not see the Father when He offers gifts  
Will see Him at the Judgment as the Righteous Judge.  
The awesome Judge has many servants,  
And employs them all for man's salvation—  
The earth's thorns; serpents and beasts;  
And floods, lightning, thunder from the sky;  
And evil winds of illness; the sun, heat and darkness;  
And the field, which gives either wheat or empty straw.  
As many gifts await the faithful,  
So many scourges are woven for the evil.  
Adam's fields are watered with gentle dew,  
But Sodom and Gomorrah are mowed with a flaming sword.  
Above other created things, God loves man:  
Therefore He forgives much; therefore He waits long.  
But, when God's patience exceeds all bounds,  
Then fire, not dew, does the work.  


## REFLECTION

If God can bring forth water from a rock as a comfort to men, He is also able to send down fire from the heavens as a punishment. The fate of Sodom and Gomorrah is a classic example of God's punishment upon incorrigible sinners. That God can repeat this punishment was demonstrated over Constantinople in the year 472 A.D., during the time of Emperor Leo the Great and Patriarch Gennadius. At noon on November 6 of that year, the sky became overcast with thick, dark clouds, causing darkness on the land. These clouds turned red as fire, then became dark, and alternated their appearance continuously. This phenomenon over Constantinople lasted for a full forty days. The frightened people turned to repentance and prayer. With the emperor and patriarch, they walked in procession through the streets from church to church and prayed to God with tears and lamentation. On the final day hot black ash fell like rain from evening until midnight, then stopped. The following day dawned clear and bright, but the sooty ash lay on the ground to a depth of nine inches. With great effort, the people cleaned their houses and streets of this sooty ash, but the crops in the field were utterly destroyed. All who had understanding, understood that this was God's punishment, and that it was God's gentle punishment because the people hastened to repent before Him. Had it not been for this profound repentance for their great and accumulated sins, who knows what would have happened to Constantinople in those days? But the timely repentance of sinners, and the prayers of the Most-holy Theotokos, as well as the prayers of the countless saints and martyrs of Constantinople, greatly lessened the punishment.


## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the wondrous power of healing that proceeded from the Apostle Paul (Acts 19):

1. How the people took his aprons and handkerchiefs and placed them on the sick;

2. How all the sick were healed, and evil spirits fled from them;

3. How the words of the Savior came true, that he who believes in Him will perform greater miracles than He.

on the Head of the Church and the Body of Christ
</div>

*"And gave Him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is His body"* (Ephesians 1:22-23).
</div>
Headless humanity is given a head in the Lord Jesus, risen from the dead. The body separated from the head is grafted to its head, part by part, member by member. Not all men are the body—only those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. All are called, but only those who respond are received under the Head. The ones who respond comprise the Body that is called the Church, whose Head is the Lord. But, as the risen and glorified man, Jesus is exalted within the Holy Trinity, above all and everything on earth and in heaven, so also will His Church, His Body, be exalted to its Head, above all and everything. The whole Church, together with its Head, will stand at the right hand of the Holy Trinity—for where the head is, there also is the body. The redeemed and repentant sinners, the erstwhile adversaries of God—wandering astray like the Prodigal Son and headless as a dead body, but now adopted through Christ and for Christ, and clothed in the beauty of divine life and splendor—will be exalted to such heights, greatness and glory. For it is a great thing, brethren: the Incarnation of the Son of God on earth, His suffering on the Cross and His death for our sake. His visit to earth brought about a great change in the destiny of men, and in the meaning of all things. He changed all things and made all things new. Therefore, brethren, let us not live and conduct ourselves as the old man, but rather as the new man; let us not live according to sin, but according to righteousness; let us not act according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. May we be made worthy of those heights, of the greatness and glory to which we are called by our Head.

O Lord Jesus, the Holy Head of the Holy Church, make us worthy to be members forever of Thy Most-pure Body.

To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
